            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I had yielded up my modeſty (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my conſciouſneſſe of my too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and too great defects) as a ſpoile to the wills and importunity of others, and had hearkened to them ſo far as to venture and expoſe theſe Sermons and my ſelf to cenſure, I did then without any deliberation or ſtudy tell my ſelf to whom they were due; nor did any thought interpoſe it ſelf, but this one, that they were not worth your eye or owning. I had once reſolved to have ſent them naked into the world without any name before them but my own; and could have been well content to have left that out alſo (for I am not over-proud of them) But then I conceived that though they could ſpeak but little for themſelves, yet they might for me (who dare not do ſo much for them) and at leaſt be as a witneſſe or <hi>Manifeſto</hi> of my deep apprehenſion of your many noble favours, and great charity to me and mine, when the ſharpneſſe of the weather, and the roughneſſe of the times had blown all from us, and well-neer left us naked. And to this end with all the heartineſſe, and height of thankfulneſſe I here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them, and humbly put them into your hands, that when you turn them over, you may read ſomething
<pb facs="tcp:59296:3"/> beſides my imperfectios, even that truth which will make you happy, and with it my gratitude. I would not be the grave of that charity which can never dye, but when we are dead will follow us; and (I thank God) I <hi>underſtand a benefit,</hi> and can behold it in all its circumſtances; and to me it appears freſher and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer every Day, putting me in mind from whence it came, and by what hands it was conveyed, and it fills me with <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Praiſes,</hi> and <hi>Gratulations;</hi> and I bleſſe God, and cry <hi>Grace, Grace,</hi> unto the hand and inſtrument. Worthy Sir, this is the faireſt and beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn that my poverty can make, and (I nothing doubt) but you will look upon it as the faireſt and beſt; for this I can make, and by the bleſsing of God you want no other. I ſee my ſelf deeply obliged to you, and by your favour to many other Noble and Religious Gentlemen, and I have but the ſame payment for all which I will ever pay (for a thankfull man is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in debt) even to my laſt payment, when I ſhall render up my ſoul to God that gave it. The ſame God who put it into your hearts, fill your hearts with that Joy which is the purchaſe of Charity. I cannot end, but with my hearty prayer to the God of bleſsings for a bleſsing on you and your whole family, which is the dayly prayer of</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat <hi>the way of man is not in himſelf,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jer. 10.23.</note> That it is not in him to direct his ſteps in that way which he chalks out, I have found true in my ſelf, and am made an inſtance of it in the trueſt and moſt naturall ſenſe of the words: and that our purpoſes ſink and faile almoſt as ſoone as they are up; that in matters of this indifferency (and would it were not ſo in thoſe of the greateſt concernment) we think we reſolve when we doe but think; and what ſtrength hath ſuch a thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a friend, and Importunity?</p>
            <p>I ſaw well enough the hazard before me which I was to run: I knew there was too much of this kind of work abroad in the world already, and if there were none, yet there would be too much by mine. I ſaw the roughneſſe of the times, and the uncertainty of the weather, and what a weak and thin bottome I put out in, and could not hope for that ſecurity abroad, which my cell and ſilence will ſcarcely afford me. I could not be ignorant how many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall winds, and out of ſeverall coaſts, might meet and ſpend themſelves againſt me; I conceived in my ſelf that it was in vain to hope to charme the reader, and to as little purpoſe to court him into a favourable opinion, as it was for <hi>Xerxes</hi> to fetter the Helleſpont, or to write letters to mount <hi>Athos.</hi> For after all pretenſes, all Apologies, all inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations, he will be the ſame, and think and judge as he pleaſe, when we have ſaid what we can. All this I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw, or thought I did, and that Apologies were like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
<pb facs="tcp:59296:4"/> in this, and were never welcome, no not then when they were neceſſary, which was enough, one would think, to have ſtrengthened and reinforced my firſt thoughts, and ſo ſixed them againſt all other temptations, all forreign aſſaults whatſoever.</p>
            <p>But ſo it is. I ſee them now ſhaken, and turned ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, even to that which I was moſt afraid of, and muſt now prepare and arme my ſelf againſt. I that ſuffered my ſelf to be perſwaded into the danger, have now but one task to undergoe, and that is to perſwade and work my ſelf into an immoveable patience, if it overtake me; and to ſit in ſilence when the noiſe is loudeſt, when thoſe hailſtones of cenſures fly about me. Yet thus much I have to ſay for my ſelf, that had I not placed a higher eſteem on other mens judgements then mine own, had I not been adviſed ſo to do, by ſome, in whoſe judgment I was ever willing to reſt (and yet ſometimes affection gets over it, even in the wiſeſt) and had I not been by nature of an eaſie and ductile diſpoſition, too apt to be drawn out at length to any purpoſe (which hath no evil upon it) by the hand and direction of thoſe, whoſe worth and goodneſſe have wrought themſelves an intereſt in me: Had not the very name of <hi>friend</hi> been more powerfull with me then my own thoughts; I who could never yet ſhoulder it in a throng, but had rather quit my place then ſtruggle for it; who am more addicted to the forreſt and retirement, then to the City and noiſe; I who have no other buſineſſe now to do, but to agree and ſit down quietly with my poverty, and to draw down my mind within that narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe in which the iniquity of the times hath left me, ſhould not have thus taken my ſelf from my ſelf, nor took ſo much paines to draw on more, which though it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and end but in words, yet words ſometimes are troubleſome, as the barking of a dog may be to a bird, though on the wing, and out of reach: I ſhould not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have thus put my ſelf upon my Country, nor ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:59296:4"/> my triall there where the judges may be of ſeverall minds, and diverſely biaſſed, and yet meet at the ſame mark, and joyne in the ſame ſentence of condemnation, which I will not ſay envy (for what matter can my low fortunes, or theſe ſorry papers yield for that humour to gnaw on?) but the diſeſteem of my perſon, the low conceit of my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities in ſome, the diſlike of the matter in others, and of the method and manner of handling it in many, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in not a few, will ſoon make up and pronounce againſt me.</p>
            <p>But I have paſt over my <hi>Rubicon,</hi> and left it behind me, and muſt now ſtand cenſure, the ſhock of all that oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which can be but breath and words, but darts made up of aire, pointed peradventure with wit, and envenomed with ſome droppings of malice; againſt which there need no other buckler then this thought, that whatſoever I ſhall appeare, yet I am ſtill the ſame, not higher, not lower, in all the demonſtrations and fulneſſe either of Praiſe or Detraction. Or this, That Cenſure for the moſt part is but <hi>Pride in its vvantonneſſe,</hi> ſelf-pleaſing, and not much diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any that are wiſe, who may be ſtrong enough to hear without diſguſt what others are ready to vent with ſo much delight, what Wit ſuggeſts to their Paſſion, and what Paſſion utters by the Tongue.</p>
            <p>And ſuch Readers I may have, and too many ſuch, ſome of the ſame faith and opinion, who yet will miſlike ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; others not alike principled, who will condemn all. To the firſt I have nothing to ſay; and to theſe but this, That I cannot be of their opinion, nor move as they do, till more weight of reaſon be hung on. Yet, I nothing doubt but to find many more candid and charitable, and who will give fairer welcome and entertainment to theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, then peradventure they do deſerve, and peruſe them with an eye no more ſevere and averſe, then their eare was when they firſt heard them from my mouth. And for ſatisfaction to theſe I ſhall give up this account for my ſelf,
<pb facs="tcp:59296:5"/> that they are now publiſht to the eye with the ſame mind and intention which firſt breathed them forth unto the eare; and that was firſt, to work men off from thoſe errors which are ſo common in the world, and have gained ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and kindneſſe, and reception becauſe they are ſo; ſecondly, to draw up their love and induſtry to neceſſary truths, that they may not ſpend and waſte them there where they may perhaps ſatisfie their humour, but not fill their ſoules, but fix and tye them to that which is moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall, which hath the favour of God, and happineſſe evermore annex unto it, and ready to Crown it; thirdly, to draw up the meanes to the <hi>end,</hi> the duty to the reward, by that neceſſary relation which is betwixt them (this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way, and there being no other unto it) and this with that plainneſſe and evidence laying it open as neer unto the eye, as the matter being ſpirituall would permit, and my weake abilities and diligence could bring it. In which if I have failed, or come ſhort (as I muſt needs do) of thoſe who have a more quick and ſearching eye, and a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter art &amp; felicity in clothing and uttering their conceptions, I muſt make uſe of that Apologie of an Apocryphall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Concedendum eſt mihi,</hi>

               <hi>If I have done ſlenderly and meanly, it is that which I could attain to,</hi> and I have no other argument but my good will and endeavour to ſpeak for me.</p>
            <p>And firſt, how weakly ſoever I have carried it on, yet I made it my aime and principall intendment, to lay all le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell before me, &amp; to remove thoſe practicall errours which are moſt common and regnant, which men walk in as in the waies of righteouſneſſe, and glory in as in the truth it ſelf; which grow up in the world like thoſe weeds which run and ſpread themſelves over the ſurface of the water, but have no root, even thoſe errours which are the proper iſſues of luſt and idleneſſe, with which men infect, and in which they applaud one another, and ſo move toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with content and danger; which are improved by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, and at laſt raiſed up to the power and dignity of a
<pb facs="tcp:59296:5"/> Law. It was well obſerved by <hi>Seneca, Cùm error ſingulorum fecerit publicum, errorem ſingulorum facit publicus,</hi> the beginning of errours is from private perſons, but the continuance and life of them is from the multitude, who are firſt daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the authority and practice of ſome few, and then take it from one another, and hold it up as a ball from hand to hand, and the publickneſſe of it gaines authority, and interchangeably prevailes with private men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and embrace it; it firſt ſteals or begs an entrance, and when it is common and publick it reigns. From hence are thoſe noxious yet beloved errours, of which men are ſo tender and jealous, that if you do but breath againſt them, or but look towards them with an eye which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayes but the leaſt diſlike, they preſently ſwell and rage as againſt an enemy, and are never at eaſe, but in his ſnare who is ſo. <hi>Proficit ſemper contradictio ſtultorum ad ſtultitiae de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrationem,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hilary:</hi> the perverſneſſe and contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of weak and wilfull men is violent and impetuous, to gain ground, and out-run that truth which ſhould ſtay and moderate it; but the greateſt progreſſe it makes in theſe its eaſie and pleaſant journeys, is to make it ſelf more open and manifeſt, like <hi>Giges</hi> wife, who was ſeen naked of all but herſelf. From hence have thoſe errours crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church which have leſſened her number, and filled her up, not with members but with names; from hence it is <hi>that God is made more cruell then man, and yet more mercifull then he is; that men are Saints, and yet the Law impoſsible; that the beginnings of obedience are ſet down for perfection; that men are made perfect, and yet ſin oftner then they obey; that our endeavours are performances, and our weakeſt and moſt feeble thoughts are endeavours; that hearing is faith, and faith fancy; that imputed righteouſneſſe is all, when we have none of our own; that we may be reputed good when we are notoriouſly evil; that our election may be ſure, though we do not make it ſo, and that we muſt aſſure our ſelves, when we have more reaſon to deſpaire; that aſſurance is a duty, and to work it out is none: from hence it is that Chriſtian liberty is let looſe againſt Chriſt himſelf, and the ſpirit
<pb facs="tcp:59296:6"/> brought in to contradict it ſelf; and God, to do himſelf what he doth command;</hi> that grace is miraculous and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible, and the will is but a word which ſignifies nothing, or if it do, it is that which cannot will. All theſe we find in the books and writings of ſome who have gained a name and repute in the world, preſented indeed in a vaile, but ſo thin, and with ſo little art of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment, that they are underſtood by too many in that ſenſe which the fleſh will ſoon admit and make uſe of to all its purpoſes; and though when they are urged with the danger of ſuch poſitions, and the horrour of ſuch conſequences which naturally iſſue from them, they ſeem to diſown and reject them as none of theirs, and doe many times in their Poſtills confute their Doctrine with their Uſe, and their Premiſes with their Inferences; yet it is with that art which <hi>Tiberius</hi> uſed in the refuſall of the Empire, <note place="margin">Suspruſa ſemper &amp; obſcura ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba <hi>&amp;c.

               </note> with doubtfull and perplext words, and as he, naming but one part when they mind the whole, will not and yet would ſay all, as he would not and yet would be Emperour. And after all ſhifts and evaſions, after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny affirmations and negations, after ſo many limitations and diſtinctions, and riddles, <hi>Sol Apollo, &amp; Apollo Sol,</hi> as it is in the proverb, we have but ſeverall expreſſions for the ſame thing; and what they would have and what they would not have, what they doe ſay and what they will not ſay; to be perfect yet moſt deficient; to think and to endeavour; to begin in the Spirit, and to end in the Spirit; to be forced &amp; to be led; to be willing and not to will; to be irregular &amp; to be free; to be certain without aſſurance, and aſſured without diligence; to be Saints and yet unholy, to be Adulterers and to be members of Chriſt, differ no more in their ſenſe, then the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> doe in the Poets, which are but ſeverall names of one and the ſame planet.</p>
            <p>I thought it therefore, and took it upon me as a work not unworthy of my place and calling, and which might bring ſome advantage to my Auditors, to indeavour at leaſt
<pb facs="tcp:59296:6"/> the removall of thoſe errours, which to me ſeemed to come ſo neer as to take part with mens luſts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and worſer part, and to flatter and feed our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is wanton of it ſelf, and ever ready to break forth without ſuch incitements; and which did give it ſo much power and line in many, though through Gods preventing grace it wrought not the ſame ſo pernicious and killing effect in all. And I conſidered not what did alwaies, but what if we reſpect the errours themſelves, and the inclinations of the fleſh, was moſt likely, and would moſt naturally flow from them; to which if I have not brought ſo much ſtrength as ſome may look for (who ſtand as much at diſtance, and are as much afraid of them as my ſelf) or as the work it ſelf may require; If I have left them ſomething to ſay, who will never want ſomething to ſay though they can ſay nothing, yet I lookt upon it as my duty; and though I doe not riſe ſo high as to the ſatisfaction of others, yet ſome ſatisfaction it will bring to my ſelf that I did endeavour it.</p>
            <p>And I was the more forward in this work, becauſe I ſaw men not onely entertain theſe doctrines, but love them, and prejudge all others which look from them another way, as thoſe which lead from that truth which is ſaving, into danger, and ſo to labour almoſt irrecoverably under prejudice, whoſe Tyranny keeps men in more awe and obeyſance, then the ſway of thoſe affections which are ſudden and mutable could do. For we ſee the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are blind, and when they carry us along with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence they do not judge but chooſe: <hi>unicui<expan>

It is open to our obſervation, that what men doe out of paſſion they doe they know not how; and the greateſt reaſon they have, is, that they doe it: and if in paſsion we paſſe any judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is not long-liv'd, but waſtes, and decayes, and dyes with it. But <hi>Prejudice</hi> is a rooted and a laſting evil, an evil we are jealous of, becauſe we think it good, and we build upon it as upon a ſure foundation; ſo that he that looks but towards it, that doth but breathe againſt it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears as an enemy that comes to dig and caſt it down. Sometimes we ſee it is raiſed by the affections, ſometimes the affections intermingle and weave themſelves with it, but moſt commonly they come in the Reare of Prejudice, and follow as the effects of it, and help to ſtrengthen and continue it. And thus we love him who is of our opinion, becauſe it is ours; and we hate him who oppoſeth it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame reaſon: we are afraid of every proffer, and angry with every word that is ſpoken againſt it. And this gathers every Conventicle, this molds every Sect, coynes every Hereſie; and it is that Sword which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſpeaks of, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.34. which makes diviſion of a <hi>man from his Father,</hi> and a daughter from her mother, and makes enemies of thoſe <hi>who are of a mans own houſhold.</hi> It is that Eaſt-wind which brings in the Locuſts vvhich cover the face of the Church, and make it dark, and eats up thoſe fruits of Peace and Holineſſe vvhich othervviſe vve might gather.

               <hi>in the Church,</hi> in Controverſies concerning Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; for in Philoſophicall Treaties, new Diſcoveries are very vvelcome, and if there riſe any debate, it goes no farther then to curſt vvords, and ſeldome breaks out to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall hazard; but theſe of more divine ſpeculation, vvhich ſhould be managed vvith peace and charity, are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held up vvith great heat, and pride of Wit, vvhich ſome
<pb facs="tcp:59296:7"/> call Shame, vvhich men have to ſeem to have erred.

So harſh a thing it is to the nature of Men to ſeem to have miſtaken, and ſo powerfull is Prejudice; for to confeſſe an Error, is to ſay we vvanted Wit.</p>
            <p>And therefore vve ſhould fly from Prejudice as from a Serpent, for it deceives us as the Serpent did <hi>Eve,</hi> gives a <hi>No</hi> to Gods <hi>Yea;</hi> makes men true, and God a lyar, and nulls the ſentence of death. <hi>You shall dye the death,</hi> vvhen this is the Interpreter, is, <hi>Your eyes shall be opened;</hi> and to deceive our ſelves, is to be as Gods, knovving good and evill. And it may vvell be called a Serpent, for the biting of it is like that of the <hi>Tarantula,</hi> the working of its venome makes us dance and laugh our ſelves to death, for a ſettled prejudicate though falſe opinion may build up as ſtrong reſolutions as a true. <hi>Saul</hi> was as zealous for the Law, as <hi>Paul</hi> was for the Goſpel; a heretick will be as loud for a fiction as the <hi>Orthodox</hi> for the truth; the Turk as violent for his Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met as a Chriſtian for his Saviour. <hi>Habet Diabolus ſuos Martyres,</hi> for the devil hath his Martyrs as well as God; and it is prejudice which is that evil ſpirit that caſts them into the fire and the water; that conſumes or drownes them; that leads them forth like <hi>Agag delicately</hi> to their death.</p>
            <p>And this is moſt viſible in thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; we may ſee even the marks upon them, obſtinacy, inſolency ſcorn and contempt, a proud and high diſdain of any thing that appeares like reaſon, or of any man that ſhall ſpeak it to teach and recover them; which are certainly the ſignes of the biting of this ſerpent <hi>prejudice,</hi> or (as ſome will call it) the marks of the beaſt. <hi>Quam gravis incubat?</hi> how heavy doth prejudice lye upon them who are taught to renounce their very ſence, and to miſtruſt, nay to deny their reaſon? who ſee with other mens eyes, and heare with

               <hi>qui non animo ſed auribus cogitant,</hi> who do not judge with their mind but with their eares? the firſt prejudice is, that <hi>theirs is the Catholick Church and cannot erre,</hi> and then all other ſearch and enquiry is vain, as a learned writer obſerves: for what need they go further to find the truth, then to the high prieſts chaire; to which it is bound? and this they back and ſtrengthen with many others of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> making that moſt true which is moſt ancient, and yet <hi>omnia vetera nova fuere;</hi>

If the firſt be not true, then theſe were nothing, and if theſe pillars be once ſhaken (and they are but mud) that Church would ſoon ſink in its reputation, and not fit ſo high as magiſterially to dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate to all the Churches of the world.</p>
            <p>And as we have ſet up this Queen of Churches as an enſample of the effects of prejudice, ſo may we hold it up as a glaſſe to ſee our own. She ſayes we are a Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, we pleaſe and aſſure our ſelves, that we are a reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:59296:8"/> Church, and ſo we are, and yet prejudice may find a place even in the Reformation it ſelf. <hi>Rome</hi> is not onely guilty of this, but even ſome members of the Reformation, who think themſelves neereſt to Chriſt, when they run far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt from that Church, though it be from the truth it ſelf. And this is nothing elſe but prejudice, to judge our ſelves pure becauſe our Church is purged, to be leſſe reformed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is reformed, or to think that heaven &amp; happineſſe will be raiſed and reſt upon a <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Name,</hi> and that we are Saints as ſoon as we are Proteſtants. Almoſt every Sect and every Faction labours under this prejudice, and feels it not, but runs away with its burden; and too many there be who predeſtinate themſelves to heaven, when they have made a ſurrendry of themſelves to ſuch a Church, to ſuch a company or collection, nay ſometimes but to ſuch a man. I accuſe not <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin</hi> of errour, but honour them rather, though I know they were but men; and I know they have erred, or elſe our Church doth in many things, and it were eaſie to name them. But ſuppoſe they had broacht as many lyes as the Father of them could ſuggeſt, yet they who have raiſed them in their eſteem to ſuch an height, muſt needs have too open a breaſt to have received them as oracles, and to have lickt up poyſon it ſelf if it had fallen from their pens; ſince they have the ſame motive and inducement to believe them when they erre, which they have to believe them when they ſpeak the truth, and that is no more then their name. <note place="margin">Orat. pro Muraena.</note>

Of this we may be ſure, there is not, there cannot be any influence in a name to make a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion true or falſe; and if we fix it in our mind as in its fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, it will ſooner dazle then enlighten us. Nor is it of ſo great uſe as men may imagine; for they who read or heare, can either judge, or are weak of underſtanding. To them who are able to judge and to diſcern errour from truth, a name is but a name and no more, and is no more eſteemed, for they look upon the truth as it is, and receive it for it ſelf; but for thoſe who are of a narrow capacity, and faile in their intellectualls, a <hi>Name</hi> will ſooner lead them into errour then into truth; or if into truth, it is but by chance, for it ſhould have found the ſame welcome and entertainment, had it been an errour, for the names ſake; for a name is their rule and not the thing. All they now gain is, that having ſuch a leader, they ſhall fall with more honour into the ditch.</p>
            <p>It will be good then to be wary and watchfull againſt our ſelves, and ſo to deprehend our ſelves, and not to love our ſelves ſo as to be the greateſt enemies we have; not to take that upon truſt to which we entruſt our ſoules, and on which we depend as our ſureſt guide to that happineſſe which now our hope and expectation looks on; but to try and examine even the truth it ſelf, and to know what ground we ſtand on; whether our foundation be firm and ſure, whether that which we have been taught, be not now to be unlearned; whether we have not took up that which we ſhould have run from; delighted in that which we ſhould hate; loved that which we ſhould have feared; whether we have not been too long familiar with that which will undoe us; whether our naturall temper and complexion, education and cuſtome have not carried us ſo far from our ſelves with that ſwift but inſenſible moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that we had no leiſure to look back and conſult with
<pb facs="tcp:59296:9"/> our reaſon, which was given us for our beſt help and guide; whether delight, or profit, or honour, and ſecurity did not make up our Creed for us; whether in our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the truth, they were not the onely lure which we did ſtrike upon, and now adhere to as to the truth it ſelf: it will be good thus to try and examine every concluſion which we have have made our rule, to let one day teach another, and maturity overſee and judge our greener yeares, and the wiſdome of age correct the eaſineſſe of our youth, reaſon recognize our education, conſideration controll cuſtome, judgment cenſure our delight, and the new man crucify the old. In a word, to think that we may have erred, and not to be ſo wiſe, as, becauſe we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, to be ſo for ever.</p>
            <p>Of this we may be ſure (for it is obvious to our eye) that our education can be no forcible motive to bind us everlaſtingly to any concluſion; for our pupillage doth too often moſt unfortunately fall under ſuch tutors, who inſtill not any principles into us but their own, which are not alwaies true, but more often falſe, being ſuch which they alſo took up upon truſt from their inſtructers. And then cuſtome prevailes more in evil then in good, and in thoſe waies, in which the fleſh is carried on with a ſwindge and violence, then in thoſe in which we uſe to move but heavily; and there be a thouſand falſe fires at which we kindle our delight, and can be but one true one. And therefore in theſe concluſions which we our ſelves deduce and draw out of known principles (in which all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and in which out firſt judgement is our laſt) we muſt be free and diſengaged, not in ſubjection to any man, or any thing, not under the awe of our firſt Inſtructers, or of Cuſtome, or any Name under the Sunne; or of our ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and delight, which we ſo often miſplace; or of profit and advantage, which name we commonly give to that which undoes us. Nor muſt we be ſo poſitive, ſo wedded to our own decrees, as to be averſe and ſtrange
<pb facs="tcp:59296:10"/> when a faire overture is made of better, becauſe having no ſurer conduct then theſe, it is more probable we ſhould erre then judge aright; and from hence error hath mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied it ſelf, and is that monſter with ſo many heads, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from this preſumption in men, that they cannot erre; and we ſee many moſt concluſive and confident in that which they have but lightly lookt upon, but never came ſo neer as to ſurvey it, and ſo diſcover what it is. For if men were either impartiall to themſelves, or ſo prudently humble, as to hearken to the judgement of others, and to try and examine all, the Prince of this world and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lies would not have ſo much in us, nor ſhould we be in danger of ſo froward a generation. If men were not ſo ſoon good, they would not be ſo often evil; if they were not ſure, they would not erre; and if they were not ſo wiſe, they would not be ſo much deceived.</p>
            <p>Nor doth this ſubmiſſion and willingneſſe to heare rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon blaſt or endanger that truth which reaſon or revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath planted in us, but improves it rather to a fairer growth and beauty, as we ſee Gold hath more luſtre by its triall. And this readineſſe to heare what may be ſaid ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for or againſt it, is a faire evidence that we fell not upon it by chance, nor received it as we do the devils tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, at the firſt ſhew and appearance, but have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely and carefully deliberated, and faſtened it to our ſoules by frequent meditation, and are rooted and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht in it.

Thus it entertaines truth for it ſelf, nor ſuffers errour to enter but in that name and reſemblance; and when truth appeares in its raies and glory, and that light which doth moſt throughly and beſt diſcover it, it runs from errour as from a monſter, and bowes to the Scepter and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of truth; is never ſo wedded to any concluſion though never ſo ſpecious, as not to be ready to put it by and forſake it, when another preſents it ſelf before it, and hath better evidence to ſpeak for it, and commend it to its choice and practice. Thus Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of the Law, and after that a Martyr of the Goſpel. Thus he perſecuted Chriſtians, and thus he dyed one. Thus Saint <hi>Peter</hi> would not converſe and eat with the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, as polluted and unclean; and when <hi>the ſheet was let down,</hi> and in it the will of Chriſt, preached unto them and baptized them, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. And this is the mother of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; for what is repentance but the changing of our mind upon better information? This, if it were well pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, would fill the world (which is now full of errour) with Recognitions and Recantations, which are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſions, but the triumphs over a conquered errour, as the rejoycings and Jubilees of men who did ſit in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but have now found the light. This would be an Amulet and ſure preſervative againſt prejudice, and thoſe common and prevailing errours to which it gives life and ſtrength, and which ſpread themſelves as the plague, and infect whole Families, Cities, and Nations. In brief, this
<pb facs="tcp:59296:11"/> would make our errours more veniall, and men more peaceable; for he that ſeeks the truth with this impartiall diligence, is rather unfortunate then faulty if he miſſe it; and men would never advance their opinion with that heat and malice againſt diſſenters, if they could once enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this thought, that it is poſſible that they themſelves may erre, and that that opinion (in which they now ſay they will dye) may be falſe; if they did not reſt in the firſt evidence as beſt, and ſo ſuffer it to paſſe unqueſtioned, and never ſeek for a <hi>ſure word of propheſie,</hi> or a well grounded aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that this is one. For if this were done, as it ſhould, either errour would not overtake, or if it did, it could not hurt us.</p>
            <p>But this is an argument of a large compaſſe, a ſubject full and yielding much matter, and I was but to declare my mind and intention, which may better thrive, and be more ſeen under the manage of more nimble and ready wits, and the activity of a better hand and pen.</p>
            <p>Second; and as I thought it worth my paines and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſtrike at thoſe common errours at which ſo many ſtumble, and into which they willingly fall, and with great complacency; ſo did I ſet up (in the courſe of my office and miniſtery) this deſire (and I could not bring much more then deſire) to preſent (in as faire an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance as I could) thoſe more neceſſary and eſſentiall truths, by the embracing of which we lay hold on happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and come neereſt to it; and to ſet them up as a mark at which all mens actions ſhould eſpecially aime. For if this be once obtained, the other will follow of it ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe truths are not ſo obnoxious and open to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and men would not run into ſo many obliquities, if they did principally and earneſtly intend that to which they were everlaſtingly and indiſpenſably bound; nor could they ſo often erre, if they were willing to be good. It was as wiſe counſell as could have been given, to thoſe who ſate to ſolve knotty doubts, and to determine controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
<pb facs="tcp:59296:11"/> in Religion in the Council at Dort, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Beati paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fici.</hi> King James his Motto or Dicton.</note> and it was given by a King, and it would have made good his motto, and ſtyled him a peacemaker, though there had been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to contribute to that title; <hi>Pauciſsima definienda, quia pauciſsima neceſſaria,</hi> that they ſhould not be too buſie and earneſt in defining and determining many things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo few were neceſſary; which counſel, if men had thought it worth their eare and favour, and willingly bowed to it, had made the Church as <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> a City compact within it ſelf, and there would have been abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of peace ſo long as the moon endureth. For queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in divinity are like meats in this, the more delicate and ſubtile they are the ſooner they putrifie, and by too much agitation and ſifting anoy and corrupt the rule; whileſt men are more ſwift and eager in the purſuit and advance of that humour that raiſed them, then in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe truths which are but few and eaſie, and with which they might build themſelves up in their holy faith. <hi>Lex nos innocentes eſſe jubet non curioſos,</hi> innocency, and not curioſity is the fulfilling of the Law; <note place="margin">Senec. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trov.</note> as it is not luxury which raiſeth an healthfull conſtitution, but temperance, and thoſe meats which are as wholeſome as common.</p>
            <p>The ſumme of all Chriſtianity is made up in this, to levell and place all our hope where it ſhould be, on God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, <hi>to love him, and keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> which are both open and eaſie when we are willing. In other more nice then uſefull diſquiſitions, I am well pleaſed to be puzzled and to be at loſſe (and yet am not at loſſe, becauſe I cannot loſe that which I would not, which I cannot have) and I reſolve for God, and not my ſelf, or indeed for my ſelf becauſe for God; and my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is moſt ſatisfactory, that I believe the thing, and God onely knows the manner how it is, and doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reveale it becauſe it is not fit for me to know.</p>
            <p>When I am to appeare before God in his houſe, and at his table, I recollect my thoughts and turn them upon my
<pb facs="tcp:59296:12"/> ſelf; I ſeverely inquire in what termes I ſtand with God and my neighbour; whether there be nothing in me, no imagination which ſtands in oppoſition with Chriſt, and ſo is not ſuitable with the feaſt, nor with him that makes it. And when this is done, my buſineſſe is at an end (for to attempt more is to do nothing, or rather that which I ſhould not do) but I do not ask with the Schooles, how the ten predicaments are in the Euchariſt, how the bread is con—or tranſubſtantiated, or how the body of Chriſt is there; for they who ſpeak at diſtance moſt modeſtly, and tell us it is not corporally, but yet 'tis really there, yet do not ſo define as to aſcertain the manner, but leave it in a cloud and out of ſight. <hi>I know that my redeemer liveth,</hi> and that he will raiſe me up at the laſt day, for he hath promiſed who raiſed himſelf, <hi>and is the firſt fruits of them that slept;</hi> but I do not enquire what manner of trumpet it ſhall be which ſhall then ſound, nor of the Solemnity and manner of the proceeding at that day; or how the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which ſhall riſe, can be the ſame numericall body with that which did walk upon the earth. It is enough for me to know, that it is ſown in diſhonour, and ſhall be raiſed in glory, and my buſineſſe is to riſe with Chriſt here, and make good my part in this <hi>Firſt Reſurrection;</hi> for then I am ſecure, and need not extend my thoughts to the end of the world to ſurvey and comprehend the <hi>Second.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To add one inſtance more in the point of juſtification of a ſinner, in which after ſixteen hundred yeares preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel and more, we do not yet well agree, and yet might well agree, if we would take it as the Scripture hath reacht it forth, and not burden it with our own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and ſpeculations, with new concluſions forced out of the light to obſcure and darken it; for when this burden is upon it, it muſt needs weigh according as the hand is that poyſeth it. And what neceſſity is there to ask whether it conſiſt in one or more acts, ſo I do aſſure my ſelf that it is the greateſt bleſſing that God ever let fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:59296:12"/> the children of men? or whether it be perfected in the pardoning of our ſinnes, or the imputation of univerſall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, or by the active and paſsive obedience of Chriſt? when 'tis plain that the act of juſtification is the act of the judge, and this cannot ſo much concern us as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit it ſelf, which is the greateſt that can be given; (I am ſure) not ſo much as the duty, which muſt fit us for the act. It were to be wiſht that men would ſpeak of the acts of God in his own language, and not ſeek out divers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, which do not edifie, but many times ſhake and rend the Church in pieces, and lay the truth it ſelf open to reproch, which had triumphed gloriouſly over errour, had men contended not for their own inferences and deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but for that common faith which was once delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Saints. And as in juſtification, ſo in the point of faith by which we are juſtified, what Profit is it buſily to enquire whether the nature of faith conſiſts in an obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious aſſent, or in appropriating to our ſelves the grace and mercy of God, or in the meer fiduciall apprehenſion and application of the merits of Chriſt? whether it be an inſtrument, or a condition; whether a living faith juſtifies, or whether it juſtifies as a living faith; what will this add to me, what haire to my ſtature, when I may ſettle and reſt upon this, which every eye muſt needs ſee, that the faith by which I am juſtified muſt not be a dead faith, but a faith working by charity, which is the language of faith, and demonſtrates her to be alive? <hi>My ſheep heare my voice,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſaith <hi>Baſil,</hi> they heare and obey, and never diſpute or ask queſtions, they taſte, and not trouble and mud that cleare water of life. It is enough for us to be juſtified; it is enough for us to be ſaved, which we may be by preſſing forward in the way which is ſmooth and plain, and not running out into the mazes and Labyrinths of diſputes; where we too oft loſe ourſelves in our ſearch, and diſpute away our faith; talk of faith and the power of it, and be worſe then infidels; of juſtification
<pb facs="tcp:59296:13"/> and pleaſe our ſelves in unrighteouſneſſe; of Chriſts active obedience, and be to every good work reprobate; of his paſsive obedience, and deny him when we ſhould ſuffer for him; of the inconſiſtency of faith and good works in our juſtification, and ſet them at as great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in our lives and converſations, and becauſe they do not help to juſtify us, think they have no concurrence at all in the work of our ſalvation. For we are well aſſured of the one, and contend for it, and too many are too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of the other. There is indeed a kind of intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in moſt of us, a wild and irregular deſire to make things more or leſſe then they are, and remove them well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer out of ſight by our additions and defalkations; and few there are who can be content with the truth, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and reſt in it, as it appeares in that nakedneſſe and ſimplicity in which it was firſt brought forth, but are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver drawing out concluſions of their own, ſpinning out and weaving ſpeculations, thin, unſuitable, unfit to be be worn, which yet they glory in, and defend with more heat and Animoſity then they do that truth which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and by it ſelf ſufficient without this additionall art. For theſe are creatures of our own, ſhaped out in our fancy, and dreſt up by us with all the accurateneſſe and curioſity of diligence, that we fall at laſt in love with them, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelves to them with that cloſeneſſe and adherency which dulls and takes off the edge of our affection to that which is moſt neceſſary, and ſo leaves that neglected, and laſt in our thoughts which is the main; as we read of <hi>Euphranor</hi> the painter, <note place="margin">Val. Max. <hi>8.12.</hi>
               </note> who having ſtrecht his fancy, and ſpent the force of his imagination in drawing <hi>Neptune</hi> to the life, could not raiſe his after and wearied thoughts to the ſetting forth the majeſty of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> for when we are ſo lively and overactive in that which is either impertinent or not ſo conſiderable, nor much materiall to that which is indeed moſt materiall, we commonly dream or are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dead to thoſe performances which the wiſdome of
<pb facs="tcp:59296:13"/> God hath bound us to as the fitteſt and moſt proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that end for which we were made.</p>
            <p>And theſe I conceive are moſt neceſſary, which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the work we have to do, and will infallibly bring us to the end of our faith and hopes. Others which our wits have hammered and wrought out of them, may be peradventure of ſome uſe to thoſe who are watchfull over them to keep them in a pliableneſſe and ſubſerviencie to that which is plain and received of all; but may prove dangerous and fatall to others who have not that skill to manage them, but favour them ſo much as to give them line and ſufferance to carry them beyond their limit, and then ſhut them up in themſelves, where they are loſt to that truth which ſhould ſave them, which they leave behind them out of their eye and remembrance, whileſt they are buſie in the purſuit of that which they overtake with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and without which the Apoſtles of Chriſt, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands before them have attained their end, and are now in bliſſe. Certainly it would be more ſafe for us, and more worthy our calling, to be diligent and ſincere in that which is plainly revealed; to believe, and in the ſtrength and power of that faith to <hi>crucify our fleſh with the Affections and luſts (Hic labor, hoc opus eſt)</hi> then to be draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Schemes, and meaſuring out the actions and operations of God; ſafer far to make our ſelves fit to be juſtified, then too curiouſly to ſtudy the manner how it is wrought; in which ſtudy we are many times more ſubtle then wiſe: in a word, to make our ſelves capable of favour and mercy; for then the work is done, and the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made, for all Gods promiſes are <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>Amen,</hi> and fall cloſe with the performance of the duty; and as to apply them to our ſelves, is our comfort and joy, our heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth; ſo to be able and fit to apply them is the work and labour of our faith and love whileſt we abide in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe points of doctrine (vvhich are but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
<pb facs="tcp:59296:14"/> and deductions made by men) whereof ſome are eaſie and naturall, and hold correſpondence and affinity with the truth as it was firſt delivered, and are upon that account to be received as faithfull ſayings of all men; other are more forced, and therefore Rejectaneous and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, as begetting more heat then love, and raiſing more noiſe then devotion; beſides theſe there be concluſions in point of diſcipline and Church-Policie, in the defence of which we ſee much duſt raiſed by men of divided minds and apprehenſions, and many times both parties well-neer ſmothered in the buzzle. For though diſcipline &amp; government be neceſſary, yet the beſt forme that was ever drawn cannot be abſolutely neceſſary, becauſe it cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies find place vvherein to ſhew it ſelf, and the holy Spirit of God never laid an abſolute neceſſity but on thoſe things which, as the Stoicks ſpeak, are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our reach and power, or which we may do or have when we will; it is neceſſary <hi>to bring into captivity every</hi> thought to the obedience of Chriſt, but it is not neceſſary to be under this or that diſcipline though the beſt, further then in affection and deſire; for in the midſt of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and chances of this world we cannot be what we would, nor be governed as we pleaſe.</p>
            <p>We ſee well enough (for it is as viſible as any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſunne) that the ſword which hath no edge or point againſt the eſſentiall parts of Religion (with which we may be certainly happy, and without which it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain we cannot) as it makes its way, dictates and appoints what it pleaſe with a <hi>non obſtante</hi> notwithſtanding all contrary conſtitutions, though never ſo ancient; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline is either quite cut off, or elſe drawn out with the ſame hand which did form and ſhape the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. We have ſeen what a flow of troubles and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in matters of this nature hath paſſed on, and carried away with it our Peace and Religion it ſelf, and then left it as it were upon the ſands to ſhift for it ſelf in the breaſts
<pb facs="tcp:59296:14"/> of ſome fevv, vvho by divine aſsiſtance are able to raiſe and cheriſh it up to ſome grovvth in themſelves, vvithout theſe helps and advantages, and to give it a place and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vver in them even in the fouleſt vveather; being forced to be their ovvn biſhops and prieſts, vvhen the hand of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence hath buried thoſe their <hi>Seers</hi> either in ſilence or in the grave. We have ſeen Religion made an art and craft, and that vvhich vvas firſt ſet up to uphold and promote it, ſtrook at and trod upon as the onely vvorme vvhich did eat it out; we have ſeen the axe laid to the very root of it by thoſe ſonnes of thunder and noiſe vvhich is heard in every coaſt vvhich theſe clouds hang over; we cannot but obſerve, vvhat art &amp; diligence hath been uſed, vvhat fire and brimſtone hath been breathed forth to caſt it dovvn; we needed no perſpective to look through the diſguiſe under vvhich they vvalk, or to behold vvith vvhat ſlight and artifice they vvrought themſelves into the hearts of the people, vvho are never better pleaſed then vvhen they are led as beaſts to the ſlaughter, and do flatter and pride themſelves moſt, vvhen they are under the yoke. We ſee it hath been the work of an age to ſhatter, and then blow away that form of Pollicie in the Church which ſhewed it ſelf to the Profit and admiration of the beſt, in ſo many; and was the faireſt bulwark the Church had to ſecure her from the Incurſions of Schiſme, Hereſy, and Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; of which (if we had no other argument) the frenzie of this preſent age, the wild Confuſion and medley of the Sects and Factions which we ſee, may be an unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable evidence: And now we have ſeen it laid levell with the ground. All this we have ſeen, but yet we do not ſee that diſcipline which did emulate and heave at it, and was placed in equipage with the Goſpel of Chriſt; we do not ſee that which was ſo much extolled as yet ſet up in its roome: Nay, we ſcarce ſee any thing left but the <hi>Idea</hi> of it, which they ſtill carry with them with expectation and great hopes, vvhich propheſy to them the building up of
<pb facs="tcp:59296:15"/> this ſecond Temple of this new form, which might it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, would, they ſay, be far more glorious then the firſt. All this art and endeavour hath been uſed to make them great and ſupreme on earth, the one half of which might have wrought out a Crown for them in a better place. For that may be had if we will, and if we be faithfull to the death it will fall upon our heads. But in what ground our lines will fall, or how they will be drawn out is a thing ſo far out of our reach and power, that no humane provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can deſign and mark it out. Day unto day teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, and the experience of all ages hath made it good, that they who like not what is, but onely what they would have, and propoſe it to themſelves and others, do many times open and pave a faire way to it, and walk forward towards it as full of hope as deſire, and yet when they are come ſo neer as even to touch and lay hold of it, may ſee it removed as far from them as before, and their hopes in their bloſſome and glory to fall off; may live to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeves in umbrage, under a more mild and friendly tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and behold that paſt by and ſunk lower which they ſo longed to ſee in that height which might amaze and awe all about them, and bring them in that harveſt which was already gathered in their expectation. I ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ſtir the blood, or draw upon me the diſpleaſure of any who have caſt in their lot with thoſe who have been earneſt in ſuch a deſign; and I have no other end but this, to ſhew the vanity and deceitfulneſſe of ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and how dangerous and vexatious a thing it is, to drive ſo furiouſly after that which hath come towards us ſo often, and then turned the back; which we overtake and loſe at once. For it is ſo in the world, and will be ſo even till the end of it, that which is mutable in its own nature may and will be changed; nor is there any thing certain but Piety and bliſſe, the vvay and the end. And therefore thoſe things which are not ſo eſſentiall to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as that ſhe cannot ſtand without them, and are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
<pb facs="tcp:59296:15"/> onely when they may be had, being exemplified and conveyed to us by the beſt hands, muſt not take up all that labour which we owe to the heat of the day, and thoſe duties of Chriſtianity which are the ſumme of all, and for which the others were ordained. When they may be had, we muſt bleſſe God, and uſe them to that end for which they were given, and when a ſtronger then we comes upon us, and removes them, look after them with a longing eye and bleeding heart, follow them with our ſorrow and devotion, uſe all lawfull and peaceable meanes to bring them back, bewaile our own ingratitude, which raiſed up that power which took them from us, and was the greateſt ſtrength they had; and ſo preſſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in that open and known way which no power can block up, in that obedience to the Goſpel which the ſword cannot reach, which no violence can hinder. For this alone can reſtore us to the favour of God, and reſtore to us thoſe advantages which we firſt abuſed, then loſt, and now ſeek carefully (as <hi>Eſau</hi> did the bleſſing) with teares. In a word, theſe helps which we would have, and cannot alwaies have, we may yet alwaies have in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and affection; but we muſt not ſo ſeek after them as to drive down all before us, and the Goſpel it ſelf, in our motion and adventure towards them, but fix our eye and deſires upon that heaven which is preſented to us in the way, and in thoſe divine rules of life from which no power on earth can abſolve and diſengage us, and for the neglect of which no neceſſity can be brought in as an Apologie; and thus bleſſe God in all things, even in thoſe which are gone from us, and cleave faſt to that which is moſt eſſentiall and neceſſary to the end, which is out of reach and danger, and which the power of darkneſſe it ſelf cannot take away.</p>
            <p>Third; and now I am come to the foot of my account, and to this all that I have to ſay is but what I can but ſay (for this preface is ſwolne beyond that compaſſe which
<pb facs="tcp:59296:16"/> my firſt thoughts drew out) and it is this, that as I was carefull to preſſe thoſe doctrines which I conceived to be moſt neceſſary, ſo I did it without any affectation, unleſſe it were of plainneſſe and perſpicuity, of which indeed I was moſt ambitious, as knowing that the Majeſty of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truths is beſt ſeen in the ſtole and gravity of a matron, and moſt times quite loſt in the ſtudied gaietry and light colours of a wanton. I could have wiſhed for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of <hi>Iſidor</hi> the Philoſopher, of whom it vvas ſaid, that he ſpake not words, but the very ſubſtance and eſſences of things, <note place="margin">

               </note> that I might have diſplayed the glory and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which is alwayes before true Piety, and pointed out to Piety as with a finger, ſhewing how it works towards it, till they both meet and are made one in eternity. And this I did endeavour (though I come ſhort of it) to draw our in ſo plain and lively a character, that he that runs might read it; that the ſight of it might raviſh the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, and force him to a love of that which ſo viſibly draws towards that end which hath no end, even the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that God which is bleſſed for evermore. <hi>We ſpeak, ſaith S.</hi> Paul, <hi>the wiſdome of God in a Myſtery, the hidden wiſdome,</hi> and the Goſpel is the revelation of that Myſtery, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25. and if it be revealed it is no longer hidden; if it be known, as far as it is known it is not a Myſtery, and if it were yet a hidden Myſtery it could not concern us, becauſe that can have no influence upon our will which yields no light at all to our underſtanding, which is as a Counſellour to the will, and ſhould convey the light unto it. The light is no more light to me then darkneſſe it ſelf, when 'tis put under a buſhel; and Myſteries when they are hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den are to us as nothing. I know now no Myſteries in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, for it is agreed on all hands, that whatſoever is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the end, is perſpicuous and naked to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: I may ſay Myſticall Divinity is an art of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing; of moving and ſtanding ſtill; of ſtriving for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and winning no ground; an art of filling men with
<pb facs="tcp:59296:16"/> thin and empty ſpeculations, in which they are lifted up aloft to ſtrange ſights and apparitions, as they ſay witches are (and as they themſelves think) when they do but dream; ſometimes it is made a vail to cover ſomething which we would not have ſeen, and we call that the Myſticall ſenſe of Scripture which is none at all.

<pb facs="tcp:59296:17"/> and ſecond notions, and termes of Art, which brought little improvement to the better part, and made men rather Talkative then Wiſe.

The Schoolmen did feaze and draw it out, and then made it up in knots; The Poſtillers play'd with it, and made it well-neer ridiculous (and we have ſeen ſome ſuch unſeemly Jiggs in our dayes) and there have been too many Theoricall Divines, who have ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond their line, beyond the underſtanding of their hearers, and beyond their own; wrought darkneſſe out of light, made that obſcure which was plain, that perplexed which was eaſie, have handled Metaphors as <hi>Chymiſts</hi> doe metalls, and extracted that out of them which Chriſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver put into them; made them leſſe intelligible by preſſing them ſo far, and by beating them out have made them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; more obſcure then the thing which it ſhould ſhew, and yields us <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

And what hath followed this bold obtruding of our own thin and forced conceits upon the Church under the high commanding form of neceſſary truths? even that which hath been obſerved of philoſophy; when men made wiſdom the onely aime and end of their ſtudies, then philoſophy was it ſelf, in its
<pb facs="tcp:59296:17"/> prime and naturall glory, being drawn up unto its proper end; but when they applied themſelves to it onely to fill up their time, or ſatisfie their ambition, or to delight their wits, then ſhe loſt her native complexion and ſtrength, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated into folly; then <hi>Epicurus</hi> raiſed a ſwarm of atomes, and <hi>Diogenes</hi> made him a tub, the Stoicks brought in their decrees and paradoxes; then there were <hi>Mille familiarum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina,</hi> ſo many Sects that it is not eaſie to draw them into a catalogue; and ſome there were who declared their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent opinions, and diſputed one againſt the other by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſignes alone, as by <hi>Weeping</hi> and <hi>Laughing;</hi> ſo we find it alſo in the Church of Chriſt, that Divinity never ſuffered ſo much as when it was made a matter of wit and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and policy and faction became moderators and ſtaters of queſtions. Then every man became an interpreter of Scripture, and every interpreter had need of another to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret him: Then men taught the Law, as <hi>Moſes</hi> received it, out of a thick cloud, and darkneſſe was drawn over the face of life it ſelf, and men received it as it was taught, and did underſtand them who did not underſtand themſelves, received it as news out of a far country, and conceived of it either more or leſſe then it was; received it in parcells and fragments, which hung like meteors in their fancy, or as indigeſted lumps in their minds, which ſoon broke out into ſores and ulcers, and one was a <hi>Libertine,</hi> another an <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt,</hi> another a <hi>Leveller;</hi> and ſome there were who did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh themſelves by the motion and geſture, and ſome (which is ſtrange) by the nakedneſſe of their bodies; and thus miſchief grew up and multiplied through the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or deceitfulneſſe of reachers, and the folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the people; which evil had not certainly ſo far over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run the Church, if men would have kept themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their own limits, and not took upon them to be wiſer then God; if the truth had been as plainly taught as it was firſt delivered, and not held out by mens ignorance or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and ſet forth with words and phraſes, and affected
<pb facs="tcp:59296:18"/> notions of our own; if all men would have contended for and reſted in that <hi>faith alone which was once delivered to the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this I markt and avoided, and in the courſe of my miniſtery run from as far as a good will with my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe could carry me; and as I ſtrook at thoſe errours which are moſt common, and did ſtrive to ſet up in their place thoſe truths which are moſt neceſſary, ſo I did indeavour to do it to the very eye, with all plainneſſe and evidence, and as neer as I could in the language of him who for us men and for our ſalvation did firſt publiſh them to the world, to which end and to which alone (next to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God) theſe my rude and ill-poliſhed papers are conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate; and if they attain this in many, or few, or but one, I have a moſt ample recompenſe for my labour, and praiſe and diſpraiſe ſhall be to me both alike; for the one cannot make theſe Sermons better, nor the other worſe. I know others before me have raiſed themſelves up to a higher pitch, and ſtrook at errour with more art, and brought more ſtrength to the building up of the Truth; and I have ſeen it exalted, and Falſhood led in triumph gloriouſly by thoſe whom God and their induſtry hath more fitted to the work, and I have but offered my ſelf up to it, as ſome <hi>ſuccours,</hi> which come when the day and heat is over, who though they doe not help, yet ſhew their good will, and we know that even they who bring on the baggage do ſome ſervice.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to be like unto him. To be like unto him? why, who would not be like unto him? who would not be drawn after his ſimilitude? Like him we all would be in his Glory, in his Transfiguration on mount <hi>Tabor;</hi> oh by all meanes build us here a Tabernacle; but like him in the cratch, like him in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, like him in his daily converſe with men, like him in the High prieſts Hall, like him in the Garden, like him on the Croſſe, here we ſtart back and are afraid of his countenance: In humility, in hunger, in ſweat, in colours of Bloud, few there be that would be thus drawn: But, if we will be his Brethren, this is the copy we muſt take out, theſe be our poſtures, theſe our Colours; bathed in his Bloud, tis true, but withall bathed in the waters of Affliction, bathed in our own teares, and bathed in our own Bloud; we meet and cope with the Devil in this our wilderneſſe; we walk honeſtly, as in the day; in <hi>that day,</hi> which he hath made. We have our Agony in our Contrition; and in our Regeneration we hang upon the Croſſe; There our luſts and affections are faſtned as it were with nayls, their ſtrength taken from them, that they cannot move in any oppoſition to Chriſt, but our anger turns from our brother who is like him, and is levell'd on ſin, which is moſt unlike him; our love ſhuts it ſelf to the world, and opens it ſelf to receive him; The hardſhip we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, brings in our fellowſhip with him; our ſuffering with him doth aſſimilate us, and in a manner Deify us; our following him in all his wayes drawes us as neer to him, as Fleſh and Bloud can approch; and our joy, our greateſt triumph is in this our <hi>Aſsimilation,</hi> and thus we come forth like unto him.</p>
               <p>And in the next place, as he was <hi>factus</hi> made like unto us, ſo are we <hi>facti ſimiles made</hi> like unto him; we are not borne ſo, we are not ſo by chance, we cannot think our ſelves, we cannot talk our ſelves into his likeneſſe, nor will he imprint it in us whilſt we ſleep, or doe worſe; this picture, this Reſemblance is not drawn out with a thought, or a word. How many be there who take his name, yet are not like unto him, becauſe they will not be made ſo? Chriſtians they are <hi>ſine ſanguine &amp; ſudore,</hi> without bloud or ſweat, drawn out not by an obedient will, but a flattering fancy; they ſtruggle not with Temptation, for they love it, they fight not againſt their Fleſh, but nouriſh, and cheriſh it, make it their labour and ambition to pleaſe it; they have no feare, no Trembling, no Agony, no Croſſe, nay they beat their fellow ſervants and perſecute them, becauſe they are like him; crucifie him in his members every day, and yet preſent
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59296:28"/> themſelves to the world as his children, as the very pictures of our Saviour, and ſo ſoon like him, that they will never be made ſo. When we ſee men faſt and pray, not that they have done evill, but that they may do more, (the Phariſees did ſo) when we ſee men bowing before him, when they are ready to lift up their heele againſt him, when we heare their <hi>Hoſannas</hi> to day, and their <hi>Crucifyes</hi> to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row (the Jewes did ſo) when we ſee men follow him as his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and call him their Maſter, and then ſell him for ſome pieces of ſilver, deliver him to their Luſts, their Ambition, their Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, (<hi>Judas</hi> did ſo, the <hi>ſon of perdition,</hi> and ſo nothing like unto a Saviour) when we ſee men waſh their hands as if they were clear of all guilt, and yet in a Tumult leave Chriſt and his Religion to be tom in pieces, and trod under feet, and to make their peace, care not what becomes of him; (<hi>Pilate</hi> did ſo) when we ſee men tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting Chriſt, to turn <hi>ſtones into bread,</hi> to do that by miracle, for which he hath fitted its ordinary proper meanes; (the Devil did ſo) when we ſee theſe men (and the world is full of ſuch) ſhall we ſay that they are like unto Chriſt? we may ſay as well, that the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees were like him, and the Jewes were like him, and <hi>Judas</hi> was like him, and <hi>Pilate</hi> was like him, and the Devil himſelfe was like him, as they. No: a Chriſtian is not ſo ſoon made up, does not grow up a perfect man in Chriſt in a moment; For though our firſt converſion be in an inſtant, yet it is not ſo in an inſtant, but that it is wrought in us by meanes, and a new making there is, whenſoever we are made Chriſtians. To be like unto Chriſt is a work of Time, and we grow up to this ſimilitude by degrees; our Faith meets with many rubs and difficulties to paſſe over; For how often doe we ask our ſelves the queſtion, How ſhould this be? and then when by prayer and meditation, and our continued exerciſe in piety, we have got the victory, we build and eſtabliſh our ſelves in our moſt holy Faith. Our Hope, what is it but a concluſion gathered by much pains and experience, by curious and watchful obſervation, by a painful peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation through all the powers of our ſouls, and actions of our life? and when with great contention we have ſettled theſe, and ſee an even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and regularity in them all, then we reſt in hope. And for our Charity, it is called the <hi>labour and work</hi> of Charity, for we muſt force out the love of the World, before we bring in the love of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; we muſt deny our covetouſneſs, before we can give a peny; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our appetite, deny our ſelves, before we can taſte of the powers of the world to come; we muſt maintain a tedious war againſt the fleſh, and be unlike our ſelves, before we can be like unto Chriſt; as he was <hi>made</hi> like unto us, ſo muſt we be <hi>made</hi> like unto him: and this is our union with him, and we are made one, even as he, and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are one.</p>
               <p>To draw the Parallel yet neerer; as there was a <hi>debuit</hi> upon Chriſt,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59296:29"/> ſo there is upon us, as it behoved him to be made like unto us, ſo it behoveth us to be like unto him: In the <hi>volume of the book it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of him,</hi> and in the ſame volume we ſhall finde it written of us, that we ſhould doe his will, and have his law in our heart, and in this as in other things, <hi>Nihil prius intuendum, quam quod decet;</hi> our firſt thought ſhould be what will become us; To ſee <hi>Nero</hi> an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour with his Fiddle, or Harp, or in his Buskins acting upon a Stage; to ſee <hi>Domitian</hi> catching of Flyes, or <hi>Hercules</hi> at the Diſtaffe; what an incongruous thing is it? An humble Chriſt, and a proud Chriſtian; a meek Chriſt, &amp; a bloody Chriſtian; an obedient Chriſt, and a traiterous Chriſtian; Chriſt in an agony, and a Chriſtian in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; Chriſt faſting, and a Chriſtian rioting; Chriſt on the Croſſe, and the Chriſtian in a Mahometicall Paradiſe, <hi>non bene conveniunt,</hi> there is no <hi>decorum</hi> in it, nothing but Soloeciſme &amp; Abſurdity, which even offends their eyes who commit the ſame, ſo boldly, as if it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with it ſome elegancy; no: <hi>debet,</hi> and <hi>oportet,</hi> we muſt act our parts with art, and a <hi>decorum,</hi> do that, which behoveth us, and it is a debt, and a debt which we muſt be paying to our lives end, to our laſt breath, and then we ſhall take our <hi>Exit</hi> with applauſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, to draw the Parallel to the full; <hi>Oportet,</hi> it is not onely beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming us, but <hi>Neceſſary;</hi> for if a kind of Neceſſity lay upon Chriſt by his contract with his Father, to be made like unto us, a great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity will lie upon us, by our covenant with him, to <hi>be like unto him;</hi> a Neceſſity, and woe unto us, if we be not. It is <hi>unum neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> it is that one thing Neceſſary, and there is nothing Neceſſary for us, but it. For run to and fro the world, and in that great <hi>Empo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium</hi> and Mart of Toyes and Vanities, find out one thing that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, if you can, though you ſearch it, as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>with Candles:</hi> Is it neceſſary to be rich?

                  </gap>; what reaſon can be given for this his Delivery? Here the object is ſo radiant, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds the ſenſe, and we ſcarce can ſee it when we look upon it; his love at ſuch an height, that our contemplation cannot reach it; and though in plain terms we are told that it was done, yet we are ſlow of heart to believe it; and therefore <hi>Photinus</hi> adopted a Son, <hi>Arrius</hi> created one, <hi>horruit Marcion, Marcion</hi> was afraid of the very thought: Deliver up he might an adopted Son, ſome excellent creature, or a phantaſme, but ſtarted back and would not come neer to ſubſcribe that he delivered up his own Son. His own Son in their Divinity, was a Son by <hi>Creation,</hi> or a Son by <hi>Adoption,</hi> or a Son in <hi>Appearance,</hi> which is not a Son. But this groundleſſe and indiſcreet care of Gods Honour, was a great ſin againſt it, and S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> obſerves, that they who denied this for fear, were far worſe, and more injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Chriſtian Religion, than they who denied it for ſtomack; this pretence of his Honour more dangerous than perverſeneſſe and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59296:32"/> pertinacy: for when pride, or vain-glory, or ambition, ſhape and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh an Errour, it is as ſoon diſcovered as the hands that wrought it; but when a ſhew of love, and piety, and zeale, paint and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it, and ſend it abroad in this glory, uncautelous and ignorant men are ſoon taken with it, never doubt, but yield, and are quickly deceived, and count it their Duty and Religion to be ſo. But why ſhould we fear where no fear is? why ſhould we fear to diſparage him, when he is ſo well pleaſed to humble himſelf? why ſhould we be wiſer than God? why ſhould we offend and ſcandalize Chriſt as <hi>Peter</hi> did? <hi>Be this far from the Lord,</hi> from the Son of God, that is, let God forbid that which he will have done? why ſhould we check his Wiſdome? or be troubled at his Love? when God will deliver him, to talk of improbability, or incongruity, or impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, is to ſpeak againſt God; If he will deliver him, his will be done, and he that reſts in Gods will doth beſt acknowledge his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
               <p>It was his will to deliver him, and this cleares all doubts, and beats down every imagination that exalteth it ſelf againſt it; If he will do it, we have but one word left us for anſwer, <hi>Amen,</hi> let it be done: he hath wiſdome and power to attend his will, and <hi>who are we that darken counſel with words without knowledge?</hi> when we fall down at his foot-ſtoole and acknowledge his infinite power; when we ſay, <hi>He onely can do wondrous works;</hi> when we in all humility acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that he can do more than we can think; that he can uphold us when we are ready to fall, enrich us in poverty, ſtrengthen us in weakneſſe, ſupply us with all neceſſary meanes and encouragements in this our race; when we preach it on the houſe tops, that he can tread down all our enemies under our feet, and bind Satan in chains; when we believe and rely on it, that he is able to immortalize our fleſh, to raiſe us out of the duſt, and ſet us in heavenly places, we think we have raiſed our <hi>magnificats</hi> to the higheſt, and indeed a Chriſtian need not ſet his Songs and Hallelujahs to a higher note; but yet we do not riſe ſo high, nor ſo fully expreſſe him, as when we give him an abſolute will; <hi>He doth what he will in Heaven, and in Earth; non vox hominem ſonat.</hi> This can belong to none but the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, to God the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; and this makes him Lord paramount, and commander of all.

He might not have done it, not have delivered him; he might, without the leaſt impairing of his Juſtice, have kept him in his boſome, &amp; never ſhewed him to the world; but as he begatus again of the word of Truth, ſo he delivered up his Son <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

For as in the Creation God might have made man as he made the other creatures by his <hi>dixit,</hi> by his word alone, but would not, but wrought him out of the Earth, and was the Potter which formed and ſhaped him out of the Clay with his own hands: ſo in the great work of our Redemption, he did not ſend a <hi>Moyſes,</hi> an <hi>Angel,</hi> a <hi>Cherubin,</hi> or <hi>Seraphim,</hi> but <hi>tradidit proprium filium, delivered up his own Son,</hi> &amp; in this delivery gave a price infinitely above that which he brought, motal, ſinfull men, which were of no value at all, but that he made them; and he payes down not a Talent for a Talent, but a Talent for a Mite, for Nothing, for that which had made it ſelf worſe than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; his Son, for thoſe who ſtood guilty of Rebellion againſt him, and his love for the world, which was at enmity with him. And thus he was pleaſed to buy his own will and love in us, and by this his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite love to bound as it were his infinite power, his infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and his illimited will; for here his power, his wiſdome, his will, may ſeem to have found a <hi>non ultra,</hi> he cannot do, he cannot find our, he cannot wiſh for us more, than what he hath done in the delivery of his Son.</p>
               <p>And now, if we ask, what moved his will? not ſure any loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or attractiveneſſe in the object; there was nothing to be ſeen but loathſomneſſe and deformity, and that enmity which might ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner move him to wrath, than compaſſion, and make him rather ſend down fire and brimſtone, then his Son: That which moved him was in himſelf, not to be found in the world, which ſtood out againſt him, and when he did come, would not receive him, but was bound up in his own bowels of mercy and compaſſion; he loved us in our blood, and loving us he bid us <hi>live,</hi> and that we might live, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up his own Son to death. For his mercy was the Orator to move his will, and being mercifull, he was alſo willing to help us; Mercy is all our plea, and it was his motive, and wrought in him a will, a cheerful will, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

Now the goodneſſe of God, and his love to his Creature, would not ſuffer him thus to ſhut up his tender Mercies, as a Fort or Town is ſhut up to be undermined, and beat upon, and overcome; but as the beſieged many times make ſallyes upon the enemy, ſo the love and mercy of our God brake forth even through his anger, and gained a conqueſt againſt the legions of his wrath. Let the World be impure, let Men be ſinners, let Juſtice be importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, let Power be formidable, and Vengeance ready to fall, yet all muſt fall back, and yield to the Mercy and Love of God, which cannot be overcome, nor bound, nor ſhut up, but will break forth, and make way through all oppoſition, through ſin, and all the powers of darkneſſe, which beſiege and compaſſe it about, and will raiſe the ſiege, drive off and chaſe away theſe Enemies, and to conquer Sin, will deliver up his Son for the Sinner. And this was <hi>aenigma amoris,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aquinas;</hi> this was the riddle, or rather the myſtery of his love to poſe the wiſdome of the world: I may ſay, being Love, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, it is no riddle at all, but plain and eaſie: for what can love doe that is ſtrange? what can it doe amiſſe? that which moved him to do it, ſhewes plainly that the end for which he did it, was very good: <hi>Dilexit nos,</hi> he loved us, is the beſt commentary on <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didit Filium,</hi> he delivered his Son for us, and takes away all ſcruple and doubt; for if we can once love our Enemies, it is impoſſible but that our Bowels ſhould yern towards them, and our will be bent and prone to raiſe them up even to that pitch and condition, which our love hath deſigned; and if our love were of that nature, Heavenly as he is Heavenly, or but in ſome forward degree proportioned to his, we ſhould ſee nothing that were difficult, nothing that were abſurd, nothing that might misbecome us, which might promote or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage them: if our Love have heat in it, our Will will be forward and earneſt, and we ſhall be ready to lay down our lives for them. For Love is like an Artificiall Glaſſe, and when we looke through it, an Enemy appears a Friend; Diſgrace, Honour; Difficulties No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. When he ſaw us weltring in our blood, his love was ready to waſh us; when we ran from him, his love ran after us to apprehend us; when we fought againſt him as enemies, his love was a Prophet; <hi>Loe all theſe may be my children.</hi> What ſpeak we of Diſgrace? his Love defends his Majeſty, and exalts this Humility of his son: <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

Look into your own ſoules; That weake apprehenſion of it, which we ſometimes have, what a night and darkneſſe doth it draw over us? what a night? nay what a Hell doth it kindle in us? what torments do we feele, the Types and ſad repreſentations of thoſe in the bottomleſſe pit? how do our delights diſtaſt us? our deſires ſtrangle themſelves? what a Tophet is the world? and what Furies are our Thoughts? what do we ſee, which we do not turne from? what do we know which we would not forget? what do we think, which we do not ſtartle at? or do we know what to think? now what rock can hide us? what moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine can cover us? we are wearie of our ſelves, and could wiſh ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not to be, then to be under Gods wrath; were it not for this, there would be no Law, no Conſcience, no Divell, but with this the Law is a <hi>killing letter,</hi> the Conſcience a Fury, and the Divell a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentor. But yet there is ſtill a difference between our apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and his, for alas! to us his wrath doth not appeare in its full Horror, for if it did we ſhould ſooner dye, then offend him. Some do but think of it, few think of it as they ſhould, and they that are moſt apprehenſive, look upon it as at diſtance, as that which may be turned away; and ſo not fearing his wrath, treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath. To us, when we take it at the neareſt, and have the fulleſt ſight of it, it appears, but as the cloud did to <hi>Elias</hi> ſervant, like a mans hand; but to Chriſt the Heavens were black with clouds and winds, and it ſhowred down upon him, as in a tempeſt of fire and brimſtone; (we have not his eyes, and therefore not his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; we ſee not ſo much deformity in ſin as he did, and ſo not ſo much terrour in the wrath of God.)

God in his approches of Juſtice, when he comes toward the ſinner to correct him, may ſeem to go like the Conſuls of <hi>Rome</hi> with his <hi>Rod</hi> and his <hi>Axes</hi> carried before him; many ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have felt his rod, and his Rod is Comfort; in his Frown, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and in his Anger, Love; and his Blow may be a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; but Chriſt was ſtruck as it were with his Axe; others have trembled under his wrath, but Chriſt was even conſumed with the ſtroke of his hand. For being delivered to his wrath, his wrath delivers him to theſe Throwes and Agonies; delivers him to <hi>Judas,</hi> who delivers, nay betrayes him to the Jewes, who deliver him to <hi>Pilate,</hi> who delivered him to the Croſs, where the Saviour of the world muſt be murthered, where Innocency and Truth it ſelf hangs betweene two Thieves. I mention not the Shame, the Torment of the Croſs, for the Thieves endured the ſame.

That the bloud of Chriſt is ſufficient to waſh away the ſinnes of the world, nay of a thouſand worlds; that Chriſt paid down a ranſome of ſo infinite a value, that it might redeeme all that are or poſſibly might be under that Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; that none are actually redeemed, but they who make him their Captaine, and doe as he commands; that is, believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; or to ſpeak in their own language, none are ſaved but the elect: In this all agree, in this they are Brethren, and why ſhould they fall out, when both hold up the priviledge of the believer, and leave the rod of the ſtubborne Impenitent to fall upon him? The death of Chriſt is not applyed to all, ſay ſome; It is not for all, ſay others; the virtue of Chriſts meritorious paſſion is not made uſe of by all, ſay ſome; it was never intended, that it ſhould, ſay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and the event is the ſame, for if it be not made uſe of and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, it is as if it were not, as if it had never been obtain'd; onely the unbeliever is left under the greater condemnation, who turned away from Chriſt who ſpake unto him, not onely from heaven, but from his croſſe, and refuſed that grace which was offer'd him, which could not befall him, if there had never been any ſuch overture made; for how can he refuſe that which never concern'd him? how can he forfeit that pardon, which was never ſeal'd? how can he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe that ſpirit of grace, which never breathed towards him? They who are ſo tender and jealous of Chriſts bloud, that no drop muſt

His love of friendſhip and complacency to thoſe whom he calls his Friends, cannot be loſt, but is as eternall as himſelf, it aſſiſts, and upholds them, and will crown them everlaſtingly.

For as the Naturaliſts obſerve of the glory of the Rainbow, that it is wrought in our eye, and not in the cloud, and that there is no ſuch pleaſing variety of colours there, as we ſee; ſo the pomp and riches, &amp; glory of this world are of themſelves nothing, but are the work of our opinion, and the creations of our fancy, have no worth, nor price, but what our luſts and deſires ſet upon them, <hi>luxuria his pretium fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit,</hi> 'tis our luxury, which hath raiſed the market, and made them va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable and in eſteem, which of themſelves have nothing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them, and ſet them off. My covetouſneſſe makes that which is but earth a God; my ambition makes that which is but aire, as heaven; and my wantonneſſe walks in the midſt of pleaſures, as in a Paradiſe; there is no ſuch thing as Riches and Poverty, Honour and Peaſantry, Trouble and pleaſure, but we have made them, and we make the diſtinction; there are no ſuch plants grow up in this world of themſelves, but we ſet them, and water them, and they ſpread themſelves, and caſt a ſhadow, and we walk in this ſhadow, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light or diſquiet our ſelves in vain. <hi>Diogenes</hi> was a King in his tub, when great <hi>Alexander</hi> was but a Slave in the world which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered; how many heroick perſons lie in chains, whileſt folly and baſeneſſe walk at large? and no doubt there have been many, who have looked through the paint of the pleaſures of this life, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held them as monſters, and then made it their pleaſure and triumph to contemn them. And yet we will not quite exclude and ſhut out riches, and the things of this world, from the ſumme, for with Chriſt they are ſomething, and they are then moſt valuable, when for his ſake we can fling them away; for it is he alone that can make Riches a gift, and Poverty a gift; Honour a gift, and Diſhonour a gift; Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure a gift, and Trouble a gift; Life a gift, and Death a gift; by his power they are reconciled and drawn together, and are but one and the ſame thing; for if wee look up into heaven, there we ſhall ſee them in a neer conjunction, even the poor <hi>Lazar</hi> in the rich mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom. In the night there is no difference to the eye between a Pearl and a Pibble-ſtone, between the choiceſt beauty and moſt abhorred deformity. In the night the deceitfulneſſe of riches, and the glory of affliction lie hid, and are not ſeen, or in a contrary ſhape, in the falſe ſhape of terrour where it is not, or glory, where it is not to be found;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59296:39"/> but when the light of Chriſts countenance ſhines upon them, then they are ſeen as they are, and we behold ſo much deceitfulneſſe in the one, that we dare not truſt them, and ſo much hope and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the other, that we begin to rejoyce in them, and ſo make them both conducible to that end for which he was delivered, and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyes to happineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All things</hi> is of a large compaſſe, large enough to take in the whole world, but then it is the world transformed &amp; altered, the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by Faith, the world in ſubjection to Chriſt; All things are ours, when we are Chriſts; for there is a <hi>Civil Dominion</hi> and right to theſe things, and this we have <hi>jure creationis,</hi> by right of Creation, for the earth is the Lords, and he hath given it to the ſons of men; and there is an <hi>Evangelical Dominion,</hi> not the power of having them, but the power of uſing them to his glory, that they may be a <hi>Gift;</hi> and this we have <hi>jure adoptionis,</hi> by right of Adoption, as the ſons of God, begotten in Chriſt. Chriſt came not into the world to purchaſe it for us, or enſtate us in it, he did not ſuffer that we might be wanton, nor was poor that we might be rich, nor was brought to the duſt of death, that we might be ſet in high places; ſuch a <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> did the Jewes look for, and ſuch a <hi>Meſsias</hi> doe ſome Chriſtians worſe than the Jewes frame to themſelves; and in his name they beat their fellow-ſervants, and ſtrip them, deceive and defraud them, becauſe they fancy themſelves to be his, in whom there was found no guile, and they are in the world as the mad Athenian was on the ſhore; every ſhip, every houſe, every Lordſhip is theirs; and indeed they have as fair a title to their brothers eſtate, as they have to the kingdome of Heaven, for they have nothing to ſhew for either. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member in 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 4.4. S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Divel the <hi>God of this world,</hi> and theſe, in effect, make him the <hi>Saviour of the world;</hi> for (as if he had been lifted up and nailed to the Croſſe for them) to him every knee doth bow, nor will they receive the true <hi>Meſsias,</hi> but in this ſhape: for thus they conceive him giving gifts unto men, not ſpirituall, but temporall, not the Graces of the Spirit, Humility, Meekneſſe, and Contentedneſſe; but Silver and Gold, dividing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances, removing of Land-marks, giving to <hi>Ziba Mephiboſheths</hi> land, making not Saints, but Kings upon the earth; and thus they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have ſet it down for a poſitive truth, that all civil Dominion is founded in Grace, that is, in Chriſt; a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which brings with it a Pick-lock, and a Sword, and gives men power to defraud or ſpoyle whom they pleaſe, and to take from them that which is theirs, either by fraud or by violence, and to do both in the name and power of Chriſt. But let no man make his charter larger than it is, and in the Goſpel we finde none of ſuch an extent, which may reach to every man, to every corner of the earth, which may meaſure out the world, and put into our hands any part
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59296:40"/> of it, that either our wit or our power can take in; for Chriſt never drew any ſuch conveyance, the Goſpel brought no ſuch tidings, but when labour and induſtry have brought them in, ſets a ſeal, imprints a bleſſing on them, ſanctifies them unto us by the Word, and by Prayer, and ſo makes them ours, our ſervants to miniſter unto, and our friends to promote, and lift us forward into everlaſting habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Our Charter is large enough, and we need not interline it with thoſe Gloſſes, which the Fleſh and the love of the World will ſoon ſuggeſt; with Chriſt we have all things, which work to that end, for which he was delivered: we have his commands, which are the pledges of his love, for he gave us them that he might give us more, that he might give us a Crown: we have his promiſes of immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and eternall life; <hi>Faciet hoc, nam qui promiſit eſt potens,</hi> he ſhall do it, for he is able to perform it: with him every word ſhall ſtand, he hath given us faith, for that is the gift of God, to apprehend and receive them, and hope to lift us up unto them: He hath given us his Paſtors to teach us (that is ſcarce looked upon as a gift) but then he hath given us his Angels to miniſter unto us, and he hath given us his Spirit, fills us with his Grace, if we will receive it, which will make his commands, which are now grievous, eaſie; his Promiſes, which are rich, profitable, which may carry us on in a regular and peaceable courſe of piety and obedience; which is our Angel, which is our God, and we call it Grace. All theſe things we have with Chriſt, and the Apoſtle doth not onely tell us that God doth give us them; but to put it out of doubt, puts up a <hi>quomodo non?</hi> challenges, as it were the whole world to ſhew, how it ſhould be otherwiſe, <hi>How will he not with him give us all things?</hi> And this queſtion addes ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and weight, and emphaſis, and makes the poſition more poſitive, the affirmation more ſtrong, and the truth of it more perſwaſive and convincing, ſhall he not give us all things? It is impoſſible but he ſhould; more poſſible for a City upon a hill to be hid, than for him to hide his favour from us; more poſſible for Heaven to ſink into Hell, or Hell to raiſe it ſelf up to his Mercy-ſeat, than for him to with-hold any thing from them to whom he hath given his Son: Impoſſible <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

                  <note place="margin">Luke 24.25 Heb. 2.20</note> from ſuffering to glory, from death to life. <hi>Tota eccleſia cum Chriſto computatur ut una perſona, Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Church</hi> are in computations but one perſon; he ought to ſuffer, and we ought to ſuffer; they ſuffer in him, and he in hem, to the end of the world; nor is any
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59296:43"/> other method, either anſwerable to his infinite Wiſdome and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which hath ſet it down in indelible characters, nor to our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and frail condition, which muſt be bruiſed, before it can be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; muſt be levelled with the ground, before it can be raiſed up; <hi>quicquid Deo convenit,</hi>

                  <hi>homini prodeſt,</hi> that which is convenient for Chriſt, is profitable for us; that which becometh him, we muſt wear as an ornament of grace unto our head; there is an <hi>oportet</hi> ſet upon both, <hi>he ought,</hi> and <hi>we ought</hi> firſt to ſuffer, and then to enter into glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; to die firſt, that we may riſe again.</p>
               <p>And firſt, it cannot conſiſt with the wiſdome of God, that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer and die, and we live as we pleaſe, and the reign with him, and ſo paſs <hi>à deliciis in delicias,</hi> from one paradiſe to another; that he ſhould overcome the Divel for thoſe who will be his vaſſals; that he ſhould foile him in his proud temptations, for thoſe who will not be humble; beat off his ſullen temptation, for thoſe who will diſtruſt and murmure; that he ſhould make his victorious death <hi>commeatum delinquendi,</hi> a licence and charter for all generations to fling away their weapons, and not ſtrike a ſtroke: If he ſhould have done this, we could not have taken him for our <hi>Captaine,</hi> and if we will not enter the liſts, he will not take us for his <hi>Souldiers; non no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vimus Chriſtum ſi non credimus,</hi> we do not know Chriſt, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him not to be ſuch a one as he is, a <hi>Captaine</hi> that leads us, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> through the Wilderneſſe full of fiery Serpents, into <hi>Canaan;</hi> through the valley of death into life.</p>
               <p>Nor is it expedient for us who are not <hi>born,</hi> but <hi>made</hi> Chriſtians, (and a Chriſtian is not made with a thought) whoſe lifting up ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſome dungeon, or priſon in which we formerly were; whoſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing looks back into ſome grave. <hi>Tolle certamen, ne virtus quidem quicquam erit,</hi> take away his combat with our ſpiritual enemies, with afflictions and tentations, &amp; Religion it ſelf were but a bare name, and Chriſtianity, as <hi>Leo the tenth</hi> is ſaid to have called it, a <hi>fable.</hi> What were my Patience, if no miſery did look towards it? what were my Faith, if there were no doubt to aſſoile it? what were my Hope, if there were no ſcruple to ſhake it? what were my Charity, if there were no miſery to urge it, no malice to oppoſe it? what were my Day, if I had no Night? or what were my Reſurrection, if I were never dead? <hi>Fui mortuus,</hi> I was dead, ſaith the <hi>Lord of life,</hi> and it is directed to us, who do but think we live, but are in our <hi>graves,</hi> entom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in this world (which we ſo love) compaſſed about with enemies, covered with diſgraces, raked up, as it were, in thoſe evils, which are thoſe locuſts which come out of the ſmoke of the bottomleſſe pit; &amp; when we hear this voice, &amp; by the vertue and power of it look upon theſe, and make a way through them, we riſe with Chriſt, our
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59296:43"/> hope is lively, and our faith is <hi>that victory,</hi> which overcometh the world.</p>
               <p>Nor need this Method ſeeme grievous unto us, for theſe very words, <hi>Fui mortuus</hi> I was dead, may put life and light into it, and commend it, not onely as the trueſt, but as a plaine and eaſie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: For by his <hi>Death</hi> we muſt underſtand all thoſe fore-running miſeries, all that he ſuffer'd before his death, which were as the Traine, and Ceremony, as the officers of the High prieſt to lead him to it; as <hi>poverty, ſcorne</hi> and <hi>contempt,</hi> the burden of our ſinnes, his <hi>Agony</hi> and <hi>bloudy ſweat,</hi> which we muſt look upon as the principles of this <hi>Heavenly ſcience,</hi> by which our beſt maſter learned to ſuccour us in our ſufferings, to lift us up out of our graves, and to rayſe us from the dead. There is life in his death, and comfort in his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; for we have not <hi>ſuch an High prieſt, who will not help us,</hi> but which is one, and a chief end of his ſuffering and death who is touch'd <hi>with the feeling of our Infirmities, and is mercifull and faithfull,</hi> Heb. 2.17. hath not onely power, (for that he may have, and not ſhew it) but a will and propenſion, a deſire, and diligent care to hold up them who are ready to fall, and to bring them back, who were even brought to the Gates of death. Indeed mercy without power can beget but a good wiſh, Saint <hi>James</hi> his complementall charity; <hi>Be ye warmed,</hi> and <hi>be ye filled,</hi> and <hi>be ye comforted,</hi> which leaves us <hi>cold,</hi> and <hi>empty,</hi> and comfortleſſe: and Power without mercy, will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ſtrengthen a weak knee,</hi> nor heale a <hi>broken heart,</hi> may as well ſtrike us dead, as revive us; but <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> when they meet and kiſſe each other, will work a miracle, will uphold us when we fall, and rayſe us from the dead, will give eyes to the blind, and ſtrength to the weak, will make a fiery furnace a <hi>Bath,</hi> a Rack a <hi>Bed,</hi> and perſecution a Bleſſing, will call thoſe ſorrowes that are, as if they <hi>were</hi> not; ſuch a virtue, and force, ſuch life there is in theſe three words, <hi>I was dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For though his compaſſion and mercy were coeternall with him as God, yet as man, <hi>didicit,</hi> he learnt it. He came into the world, as into a Schoole, and there learnt it by his ſufferings and death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.8. For the way to be ſenſible of anothers miſery, is firſt to feele it in our ſelves; it muſt be ours, or if it be not ours, we muſt make it ours, before our heart will melt; I muſt take my brother into my ſelf, I muſt make my ſelf as him, before I help him; I muſt be that <hi>Lazar</hi> that beggs of me, and then I give; I muſt be that wounded man by the way ſide, and then I powre my oyle and wine into his wounds, and take care of him; I muſt feele the Hell of ſinne in my ſelf, before I can ſnatch my Brother out of the fire. Compaſſion is firſt learnt at home, and then it walks abroad, and is eyes to <hi>the blind,</hi> and <hi>feet to the lame,</hi> and heales two at once, both the miſerable, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59296:44"/> him that comforts him; for they were both under the ſame diſeaſe, one as ſick as the other; <hi>I was dead,</hi> and <hi>I ſuffer'd,</hi> are the maine ſtrength of our Salvation. For though Chriſt could no more forget to be mercifull, then he could leave off to be the ſonne of God, yet before he emptyed himſelf, and took upon him the forme of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, <hi>ſicut miſeriam expertus non era, ita nec miſcricordiam experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento novit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hilary,</hi> as he had no experience of ſorrow, ſo had he no experimentall knowledge of mercy and compaſſion; his own hunger moved him to work that miracle of the loaves, for it is ſaid in the Text, <hi>He had compaſsion on the multitude;</hi> his poverty made him an Crator for the poore, and he begs with them to the end of the world; He had not a hole to hide his head, and his compaſſion melted into tears at the ſight of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> When he became a <hi>man of ſorrowes,</hi> he became alſo a <hi>man of compaſsion.</hi> And yet his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſorrow, in truth, added nothing to his knowledge, but ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth up a confidence in us to approach neer unto him, who by his miſerable experience is brought ſo neer unto us, and hath <hi>reconciled us in the Body of his fleſh,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Coloſſ. 1.21.</note> for he that ſuffer'd for us, hath compaſſion on us, and ſuffers and is tempted with us, even to the end of the world; on the Croſſe with Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> on the Block with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the fire with the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> deſtitute, afflicted, tormented: would you take a view of Chriſt looking towards us with a melting eye? you may ſee him in your own ſoules, take him in a groane, mark him in your ſorrow, behold him walking in the clefts of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heart, bleeding in the gaſhes of a wounded ſpirit; or, to make him an object more ſenſible, you may ſee him every day begging in your ſtreets; when he tells you, <hi>He was dead,</hi> he tells you as much; <hi>In as much as the children were partakers of fleſh and Bloud, he alſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf took part of the ſame,</hi> and in our fleſh was a hungry, was ſpet upon, was whipt, was nayld to the Croſſe, which were as ſo many parts of that diſcipline, which taught him to be mercifull; to be mercifull to them who were tempted by hunger, becauſe he was hungry; to be mercifull to them who were tempted by poverty, becauſe he was poore; to be mercifull to thoſe who tremble at diſgrace, becauſe he was whipt; to be mercifull to them, who will not, yet will ſuffer for him; who refuſe and yet chuſe, tremble and yet venture; are afraid, and yet dye for him; becauſe as man he found it a bitter Cup, and would have had it paſſe from him, who in the dayes of <hi>his fleſh offer'd up prayers, and ſupplications with ſtrong crying</hi> and teares for mortall men, for weak men, for ſinners: <hi>pertinaciſsimè durant quae diſcimus experientiâ,</hi>

                  <hi>Vivo, I am alive;</hi> Chriſt hath ſpoken it, who is truth it ſelf, and we may take his word for it, for if we will not believe him when he ſayes it, neither ſhould we believe, if we ſhould ſee him riſing from the dead. And this his life and reſurrection is moſt conveniently pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in that, <hi>Non dabis, thou wilt not ſuffer thy holy one to ſee corruption;</hi> for what ſtronger reaſon can there be found out in matters of faith then the will &amp; pleaſure of that God, who brings mighty things to paſs? &amp; to this end Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cites the 2. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and S. <hi>Peter</hi> the 16. and in this the humble ſoule may reſt, and behold the object in its glory, and ſo gather ſtrength to rayſe it ſelf above the fading vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this world, and ſo reach, and raiſe to immortality. What fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer evidence then that of Scripture? what ſurer word then the word of Chriſt?

He that will not walk by that light which ſhines upon him, whilſt he ſeeks for more, muſt needs ſtumble and fall at thoſe ſtones of offence, which himſelf hath laid in his own way; why ſhould it be thought <hi>a thing incredible,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> ſhould raiſe the dead to life? If ſuch a thought ariſe in a Chriſtian, <note place="margin">Acts 26.8.</note> reaſon never ſet it up: <hi>I verily thought my ſelf,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the next verſe, but it was when he was under the Law, and he whoſe
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59296:45"/> thoughts are ſtaggered here, is under a worſe law, the law of his members, his luſts, by which his thoughts and actions are held up, as by a law; is ſuch a one that ſtudies to be an Atheiſt, is ambitious to be like the beaſts that periſh, and having nothing in himſelf, but that which is worſe than nothing, is well content to be annihilated. For why ſhould ſuch a temptation take any Chriſtian? why ſhould he deſire clearer evidence? why ſhould they ſeek for demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? or that the Reſurrection of Chriſt ſhould be made manifeſt to the eye? That is not to ſeek to confirm and eſtabliſh, but to deſtory their faith; for if theſe truths were as evident as it is that the ſun doth ſhine when it is day, the apprehenſion of them were not an act of our faith, but of our knowledg; and therefore Chriſt, ſaith <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> ſhewed not himſelf openly to all the people at his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>ut fides non mediocri praemio deſtinata,</hi>

For what obedience can it be for me to aſſent to this, that the whole is greater then the part? that the Sun doth ſhine? or any of thoſe truths which are viſible to the eye? what obedience is it to aſſent to that which I cannot deny? but when the object is in part hidden, in part ſeen; when the truth we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to, hath more probability to eſtabliſh it, then can be brought to ſhake it, then our Saviour himſelf pronounceth, <hi>Bleſſed are they who have not ſeen, and yet have believed.</hi>

               <p>Beſides, it were in vain he ſhould afford us more light who hath given us enough; for to him that will not reſt in that which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, nothing is enough. When he rained down Manna upon the Iſraelites; when he divided the red ſea, &amp; wrought wonders amongſt them, the Text ſayes, <hi>For all this they ſinned ſtill, and believed not his wondrous works.</hi> The Phariſees ſaw his miracles, yet would have ſtoned him; they ſaw him raiſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead, and would have killed them both. The people ſaid, <hi>He hath done all things well;</hi> yet theſe were they that crucified the Lord of life. Did any of the Phariſees believe in him? we might ask, Did any of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples believe in him? Chriſt himſelf calls them <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>ſlow of heart</hi> to believe what the Prophets had foretold; their <hi>Feare</hi> had ſullied the evidence, that they could not ſee it, the Text ſayes <hi>they forſook him and fled.</hi> And the reaſon of this is plain; For though faith be an act of the underſtanding, yet it depends upon the will, and men are incredulous, not for want of thoſe meanes which may raiſe a faith, but for want of will to follow that light which leads unto
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59296:45"/> it; do not believe becauſe they will not, and ſo bear themſelves ſtrongly upon opinion preconceived, beyond the ſtrength of all evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence whatſoever; when our affections and luſts are high and ſtand out againſt it, the evidence is put by and forgot, and the object, which calls for our eye and faith, begins to diſappear and vaniſh, and at laſt is nothing; <hi>quot voluntates, tot fides,</hi> ſo many <hi>wills,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hilary.</note> ſo many <hi>Creeds;</hi> for there is no man that believes more than he will. To make this good, we may appeale to men of the ſlendreſt obſervation, leaſt experience; we may appeale to our very eye, which cannot but ſee thoſe uncertain and uneven motions, in which men are carried on in the courſe of their life. For what elſe is that that turnes us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout like the hand of a Diall, from one point to another? from one perſwaſion to a contrary? How comes it to paſs that I now embrace what anon I tremble at? what is the reaſon that our <hi>Belief</hi> ſhifts ſo many Scenes, and preſents it ſelf in ſo many ſeverall ſhapes? now in the indifferency of a Laodicaean, anon in the violence of a Zelot? now in the gaudineſs of Superſtition, anon in the proud &amp; ſcornful ſlovenry of factious Profaneneſs? that they make ſo painfull a peregrination through ſo many <hi>modes</hi> and forms of Religion, and at laſt end in Atheiſt? what reaſon is there? there can be none but this, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency and victory of our ſenſitive part over our reaſon, and the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability, yea, and ſtubborneſſe of our will, which cleaves to that which it will ſoon forſake, but is ſtrongly ſet againſt the truth, which brings with it the faireſt evidence, but not ſo pleaſing to the ſenſe. This is it which makes ſo many impreſſions in the mind: Self-love, and the love of the world, theſe frame our Creeds, theſe plant and build, theſe root and pull down, build up a Faith, and then beat it to the ground, and then ſet up another in its place. <hi>A double-minded man,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>James, is unſtable in all his wayes.</hi> Remember, <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.8.</note> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt of the ſeed of</hi> David <hi>was raiſed up from the dead, according to my Goſpel;</hi> that is a ſure foundation for our faith to build on, and there we have <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

St. <hi>Paul</hi> joyns them together, his <hi>ſitting at the right hand of God, and his interceding of us,</hi> Rom. 8.34. ſo that to leave interceding were to leave the right hand of God, where he looks down upon us, is preſent with us, and prepares a place for us; his Wounds are ſtill open, his Merits are ſtill vocall, his Sufferings are ſtill importunate, his everlaſting preſenting of himſelf before his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59296:48"/> is an everlaſting prayer, <hi>Jeſus at the right hand of the father,</hi> more powerfull than the full <hi>vials,</hi> the incenſe, the prayers, the grones, the ſighs, the roarings of all the Saints that have been, or ſhall be to the end of the world; and if he ſate not there, if he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded not, they were but noiſe, nay, they were ſins; but his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion ſanctifies them, and offers them up, and by him they are powerfull; and by this power, the ſighs, the breathing, the deſires of mortall, fading men, aſcend the higheſt heavens, and draw down eternity.</p>
               <p>And this is a part of his Prieſtly office, which he began here on earth, and continues for us, makes it compleat, holds it up to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>Again, this title of eternity is annexed to his <hi>Regality,</hi> and is a flower of his Crown, not ſet in any but his; <hi>Thou art a King for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> cannot be ſaid to any mortall. Did he not live for evermore, he could not threaten eternall death nor promiſe everlaſting life; for no mortall power can rage for ever, but paſſeth, as lands do from one Lord to another, lyes heavy on them, and at laſt ſinks to the ground with them all; nor can the hand that muſt wither and fall off, reach forth a never-failing reward; Infinitude cannot be the iſſue and product of that which is finite, and bounded within a determined period. And this might open a wide and effectuall door unto ſin, and but leave a ſad and diſconſolate entrance for Vertue and Piety, which is ſo unſatisfying to fleſh and blood, that the perſeverance in it requires no leſſe a power, than that which Eternity brings along with it, to draw it on. How bold and daring would men be before the <hi>Sun and the People?</hi> what joy and delight would fill them, did not the thought of a future and endleſs eſtate pierce ſometimes through them, and ſo make ſome vent to let it out? when the evill that hangs over them is but a cloud, which will ſoon vaniſh, few men are ſo ſerious as to look about and ſeek for ſhelter. <hi>Poſt mortem nihil eſt, Ipſa<expan>

And indeed, how weary, and how ſoon weary would men be of doing good, if there were not a laſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, if they were not half perſwaded (for a ful perſwaſion is but rare) that there were ſomething laid up in everlaſting habitations? Honour, Repute, and Advantage, theſe may bring forth a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, theſe may bind on the phylacteries on a Phariſee; but nothing can raiſe up a Saint, but eternity; nor can that which fleeteth and paſſeth away build us up in a holy faith: and then there would be no

               <p>But <hi>vivo in aeternum,</hi> I live for evermore, derives an <hi>eternity</hi> to that which in it ſelf is fading, makes our actions which end in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, and are gone and paſt, eternall; our words, which are but wind, eternall; and our thoughts which periſh with us, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; for we ſhall meet them again, and feel the effect of them to all eternity: It makes Hell eternall, that we may flie from it; and Heaven eternall, that we may preſſe towards it, and take it by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. <hi>Chriſts living for ever,</hi> eternizeth his threatnings, and makes them terrible; his promiſes, and makes them perſwaſive and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; eternizeth our faith and hope, eternizeth all that is praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, that they may be as a paſſe, or letters commendatory to prevaile and procure us admittance into his preſence, who onely hath immortality, and can give eternall life.

               <p>
                  <hi>Habeo claves, I have the keyes,</hi> is a metaphoricall ſpeech; <hi>Et me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorae feraciſsimae controverſiarum,</hi> ſaith <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> Metaphors are a ſoyl wherein controverſies will grow up thick, and twine, and plat themſelves one within the other, whileſt every man manures them, and ſowes upon them what ſeed he pleaſe, even that which may bring forth ſuch fruit, which may be moſt agreeable to his taſte and humour. Lord what a noyſe have theſe <hi>keyes</hi> made in the world? you would think they were not <hi>keyes,</hi> but <hi>bells,</hi> ſounding terrour to ſome, and making others more bold and merry than they ſhould be: Some have gilded them over, others have even worn and filed them quite away, put them into ſo many hands, that they have left none at all. For though they know not well what they are, yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man takes courage enough to handle them, and let in, and let out whom they pleaſe; one faction turns them againſt another, the <hi>Lutheran</hi> againſt the <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> and <hi>diabolifies</hi> him; and the <hi>Calviniſt</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:59296:49"/> againſt the <hi>Lutheran,</hi> and <hi>ſuperdiabolifies</hi> him. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> made it a piece of wiſdome to ſhut us out, and all that will not bow unto her, as ſubordinate and dependent on that Church; which was but idle phyſick, which did neither hurt nor good, but was as a dart ſent after thoſe who wee gone out of reach; a curſe denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe who heard it, and bleſt themſelves in it; indeed a point of ridiculouſly affected gravity, ſuch as that Church hath many: for what prejudice could come to us by her ſhutting us out, who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready put our ſelves out of her Communion? unleſſe you will think the valour of that Souldier fit for Chronicle, who cut off the head of a man who was dead before. I <hi>have</hi> the <hi>keyes,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, and it is moſt neceſſary he ſhould keep them in his hands; for we ſee how dangerous it may prove to put them into the hand of a mortall man, ſubject to paſſions, and too often guided and commanded by them; and we know what Tragedies the miſtaking of the <hi>keyes</hi> have raiſed in the world.</p>
               <p>And yet he that hath theſe keyes, this power, hath delegated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a power to his Apoſtles, not onely to preach the Goſpel, but to correct thoſe who diſobey it. I would not attribute too much to the Paſtors of the Church, in this dull and iron, or rather in this wanton age, where any thing, where nothing is thought too much for them, where all hath been <hi>preaching</hi> till all are <hi>Preachers;</hi> yet I cannot but think they have more than to ſpeak in publick, which, 'tis thought, every Chriſtian may do.

But ſuch a power Chriſt did leave unto his Church, and the neglect of it on the one ſide, and the contempt of it on the other, hath brought in that lukewarmneſs, that indifferency amongſt the profeſſors of Chriſtianity, which, if God
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59296:49"/> prevent not, will at laſt ſhake and throw down the profeſſion it ſelf, and fill the world with Atheiſts, which will learn by no Maſters but ſuch as inſtruct fools, nor acknowledge any keyes but thoſe which may break their head.</p>
               <p>But indeed we have had theſe keyes too long in our hands, for though they concern us, yet are they not the <hi>keyes</hi> in the Text, nor had we lookt upon them, but that thoſe of the Romiſhparty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they find the <hi>keyes</hi> mentioned, take them up and hang them on their Church; But we muſt obſerve a difference betwixt the <hi>keyes of the kingdome of Heaven,</hi> which were given to <hi>Peter,</hi> and the <hi>keyes of Hell and of Death;</hi> although with them, when the keyes are ſeen, Heaven and Hell are all one. For the <hi>keyes of David,</hi> which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens and no man ſhuts, and ſhuts and no man opens, were not given to the Apoſtles, but are a regality and prerogative of Chriſt, who onely hath power of life and death, over Hell and the Grave; who therefore calls himſelf the <hi>firſt</hi> and the <hi>laſt,</hi> becauſe although when he firſt publiſht his Goſpel, he died and was buried, yet he roſe again to live for ever, ſo to perfect the great work of our ſalvation, and by his power to bind thoſe in everlaſting chains who ſtood out againſt him, and to bring thoſe that bow to his Scepter out of priſon into liberty, and everlaſting life. The power is his alone, and he made it his by his ſufferings <hi>(He was obedient to death, therefore God did highly exalt him)</hi> became a Lord by putting on the form of a ſervant; but he hath delegated a power to his Apoſtles, and thoſe that ſucceed them, to make us capable, ſit ſubjects for his power to work upon, which nevertheleſſe will have its operation and effect; either let us out, ot ſhut us up for ever under the power of Hell and of Death: were not he alive and to live for evermore, we had been ſhut up in darkneſſe and oblivion for ever; but Chriſt living infuſeth life into us, that the bonds of Hell and of Death can no more hold us than they can him. There is ſuch a place as Hell, but to the living mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt there is no ſuch place; for it is impoſſible it ſhould hold them, and you may as well place <hi>Lucifer</hi> at the right hand of God, as a true Chriſtian in Hell: for how can light dewll in darkneſſe? how can purity mix with ſtench? how can beauty ſtay with horrour? If Nature could forget her courſe, and ſuffer contradictories to be drawn together, and to be both true, yet this is ſuch a contradiction, which unleſs Chriſt could die again (which is impoſſible) can never be reconciled. Heaven and earth may paſſe away, but Chriſt lives for evermore, and the power and vertue of his life is as everlaſting as everlaſtingneſſe it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And againe, There <hi>was a pale Horſe,</hi>

                  <hi>brought us into ſervility, and bondage all our life long,</hi> made our pleaſures leſſe delightfull, and our virtues more tedious then they are, made us tremble, and ſhrink from thoſe Heroique undertakings for the truth of God; but now they in whom Chriſt lives, and moves, and hath his Being, as in his own, dare look upon him in all his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, <hi>expeditum morti genus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertull:</hi> and are ready to meet him, in his moſt dreadfull march, with all his Army of Diſeaſes, racks, and Tortures; and as man before he ſinned knew not what Death meant, and <hi>Eve</hi> familiarly converſed with the Serpent, ſo doe they with death, and having that Image reſtored in them are ſecure and feare it not; for what can this Tyrant take from them? Their life? that is <hi>hid with Chriſt in God:</hi> It cannot cut them off from pleaſure, for their delight is in the Lord: It cannot rob them of their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for that is laid up in heaven: It can take nothing from them, but what themſelves have already crucified, their <hi>Fleſh:</hi> It cannot cut off one hope, one thought, one purpoſe; for all their thoughts, purpoſes and hopes were leveld not on this, but on another life. And now Chriſt hath his keys in his hand, Death is but a name, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or if it be ſomething, it is ſuch a thing, that troubled S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to define what it is: we call it a puniſhment, but indeed it is a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; a favour, even ſuch a favour, that Chriſt who is as Omnipotent, as he is everlaſting, who can work all in all, though he aboliſhed the <hi>Law of Moſes,</hi> the law of Ceremonies, yet would not abrogate this law, by which we are bound over unto death, becauſe it is ſoprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and advantageous to us; it was threatned, it is now a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or the way unto it; for death it is, that lets us in that which was promiſ'd; it was an end of all, it is now the beginning of all; it was that, which cut off life, it is now that, through which, as through a gate, we enter into it; we may ſay, it is the firſt point and moment of our After-eternity, for tis ſo neer unto it, that we can hardly ſever them; for we <hi>live,</hi> or rather labour, and fight, and ſtrive with the world, and with life it ſelf (which is it ſelf a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) and whilſt by the power of our everliving Chriſt, we hold up and make good this glorious contention, and fight and conquer, and preſſe forward towards the mark, either nature faileth, or is preſt down with violence, and <hi>we dye,</hi> that is our language; but the ſpirit ſpeaketh after another manner, <hi>we ſleep,</hi> we are <hi>diſſolved,</hi> we fall in pieces, our bodies from our ſoules, and we from our miſeries and Temp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>tionſ; and this living, everliving Chriſt gathers us together again, breaths life and eternity unto us, that we may live and reign with him for evermore. And ſo I have viewed all the parts of the Text, being the maine Articles of our faith, 1. Chriſts death, 2. his life, 3. his eternall life; and laſt of all, his power of the keys; his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59296:50"/> Dominion over hell and death; we will but in a word fit the <hi>Ecce,</hi> the <hi>behold</hi> in the Text, to every part of it, and ſet the ſeale to it, <hi>Amen,</hi> and ſo conclude.</p>
               <p>And firſt, we place the <hi>Ecce</hi> the <hi>behold,</hi> on his death; he ſuffer'd and dyed, that he might learne to have compaſſion on thy miſeries and on thy duſt, and rayſe thee from both, and wilt thou learne no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from his compaſſion? wilt thou not by him, and by thy own ſinnes and miſeries, which drew from him teares of Bloud, learne to pitty thy ſelf? wilt thou ſtill rejoyce in that iniquity which troubled his ſpirit, which ſhed his bloud, which he was willing ſhould guſh out of his heart, ſo it might melt thine, and work but this in thee to pitty thy ſelf? we talk of a <hi>firſt Converſion,</hi> and a <hi>ſecond,</hi> and I know not what <hi>Cycles</hi> and <hi>Epicycles</hi> we have found out to ſalve our irregular motion in our wayes to bliſſe; if we could once have compaſſion on our ſelves, the work were done; and <hi>when were you converted? or how were you converted?</hi> were no ſuch hard queſtions to be anſwer'd; for I may be ſure I am converted, if I be ſure that I truly pitty my ſelf; <hi>ſhall Chriſt onely have compaſsion on thy ſoule?</hi> But then again, ſhall; he ſhed his bloud for his Church, that it may be one with him and at unity in it ſelf, and canſt thou not drop a teare when thou ſeeſt this his body thus rent in pieces, as it is at this day? when thou ſeeſt the world, the love of the world break in and make ſuch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock in the Church, (oh 'tis a ſad contemplation) will none <hi>but Chriſt weep over Jeruſalem?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, let us look upon him living, and not take our eye from off him, to fill and feed, and delight it with the vanities of this world; with that which hath neither life nor ſpirit; with that, which is ſo neer to nothing; with that which is but an Idol? <hi>Behold he liveth,</hi> that which thou ſo doteſt on, hath no life, nor can it prolong thy life a moment: who would not ceaſe from man whoſe, breath is in his noſtrills? and then what madneſſe is it to truſt in that which hath no breath at all? ſhall Chriſt preſent himſelf <hi>alive</hi> to us, and for us, and ſhall we lay hold of corruption &amp; rottenneſſe? and when heaven opens it ſelf to receive us, run from it into a charnell-houſe, and ſo into hell it ſelf?</p>
               <p>But then, in the third place, <hi>Behold he lives for evermore,</hi> and let not us bound and impriſon our thoughts within a ſpan, and when immortality is offer'd, affect no other life but that which is a vapour: Let us not rayſe that ſwarme of thoughts, which muſt periſh, <note place="margin">Coloſ. 3.3.</note> but build up thoſe works upon our everliving Saviour which may follow us, follow us through the huge and unconceivable tract of eternity. Doth our Saviour live for evermore? and ſhall we have no ſpirit in us, but that which delights to walk about the earth, and is content
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59296:51"/> to vaniſh with it? Eternity is a powerfull motive to thoſe who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have ſuch penſive thoughts, as when they remember their frailty, and are ſick even of health it ſelf, and in a manner dead with life, when they conſider it as that bleſſing which ſhall have an end. Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is in our deſire, though it be beyond our apprehenſion; what he ſaid of time, is truer of eternity, if you doe not ask what it is, we know, but if you ask, we are not able to anſwer, and reſolve you, or tell you what it is; when we call it an <hi>infinite duration,</hi> we doe but give it another <hi>name, two words</hi> for one (a ſhort Paraphraſe) but we doe not define what it is. And indeed our firſt conceptions of it are the faireſt; for when they are doubled, and redoubled, they are loſt in themſelves, and the further they extend themſelves, the more weary they are, and at greater loſſe in every proffer, and muſt end, and reſt at laſt in this poore, unſatisfying thought, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think what it is. Yet there is in us a wild preſage, an unhandſome acknowledgment of it, for we fancy it in thoſe objects, which vaniſh out of ſight, whilſt we look upon them; we ſet it up in every deſire, for our deſires never have an end. Every purpoſe of ours, every action we doe is <hi>Aeternitati ſacrum,</hi> and we doe it to eternity, we look upon riches as if they had no wings, and think our <hi>habitations ſhall endure for ever;</hi> we look upon honour, as if it were not Aire, but ſome Angel confirm'd, a thing bound up in eternity; we look upon beauty, and it is our heaven, and we are fixt and dwell on it, as if it would never ſhrivel, nor be gathered together as a ſcroule; and ſo in a manner make mortality it ſelf eternall. And therefore ſince our deſires doe ſo far enlarge themſelves, and our thoughts doe ſo mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, that they never have an end, ſince we look after that which we cannot ſee, and reach after that, which we cannot graſpe, God hath ſet up that for an object to look on, which is eternall indeed, in the higheſt Heavens; and as he hath made us in his own image, ſo in Chriſt, who came to renew it in us, he hath ſhewed us a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent way unto it, &amp; taught us to work out eternity even in this world, in this common ſhop of change; to work it out of that in which it is not, which is neer to nothing, which ſhall be nothing; to work it out of riches, by not truſting them; out of honour by contemning it; out of the pleaſures of this world by loathing them; out of the fleſh, by crucifying it; out of the world by overcoming it; and out of the Divell himſelf by treading him under our feet. For this is <hi>to be in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>to be in Chriſt,</hi> is to be for <hi>evermore.</hi> Chriſt is the eternall Sonne of God, and he was dead, and lives, and lives for evermore, that we may <hi>dye</hi> and live for evermore, and not onely attaine to the Reſurrection of the dead, but to eternity.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, let us look upon the <hi>keys in his hand,</hi> and knock hard, that he may open to us, and deliver our ſoule from hell, and make our grave not a <hi>priſon,</hi> but a <hi>Bed</hi> to riſe from to eternall life; or if we be ſtill ſhut in, we our ſelves have turn'd the key againſt our ſelves; for

               <p>We will therefore in the next place enquire why he is called the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59296:54"/> 
                  <hi>Spirit of Truth,</hi> for divers attributes he hath; he is called the <hi>Spirit of Adoption,</hi> Rom. 8.15. the <hi>Spirit of Faith,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.13. the <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> of <hi>Joy,</hi> of <hi>Zeale;</hi> for where he worketh, <hi>Grace</hi> is ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, our <hi>Love</hi> is without diſſimulation; our <hi>Joy</hi> is like the joy of heaven, as true, though not ſo great; our <hi>Faith a working faith,</hi> and our <hi>Zeal a coale from the Altar,</hi> kindled from his fire; not mad and raging, but according to knowledge; he makes no ſhadowes, but ſubſtances; no pictures but realities; no appearances but truths; a Grace that makes us highly favoured, a <hi>precious</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> Faith, full and unſpeakable Love, ready to ſpend it ſelf, and zeal to conſume us; of a true exiſtence, being from the ſpirit of God, who alone truly is: but <hi>here</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> yet the ſame ſpirit that planteth grace and faith in our hearts, that begets our Faith, cilates our Love, works our Joy, kindles our Zeal, and adopts us <hi>in Regiam familiam,</hi> into the Royall Family of the firſt-born in Heaven: but now the ſpirit of Truth was more proper; for to tell men perplext with doubts, that were ever and anon (and ſometimes when they ſhould not) asking queſtions of ſuch a Teacher, was a ſeal to the promiſe, a good aſſurance they ſhould be well taught, that no difficulty ſhould be too hard, no knowledge too high, no myſtery too dark and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure for them, but <hi>Omnis veritas,</hi> all truth ſhould be brought forth and unfolded to them, and have the vayle taken from it, and be laid open and naked to their underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Let us then look up upon and worſhip this ſpirit of Truth, as he thus preſents and tenders himſelf unto us, as he ſtands in oppoſition to two great enemies to Truth; as 1. <hi>Diſsimulation,</hi> 2. <hi>Flattery;</hi> and then, as he is true in the leſſons which he teacheth, that we may pray for his <hi>Advent,</hi> long for his coming, and ſo receive him when he comes.</p>

What a price doth luxury place on wealth and riches? what horror on nakedneſſe and poverty? How doth a jewell glitter in my eyes, and what a ſlurr is there upon virtue? what Glory doth the pomp of the world preſent, and what a ſad and ſullen aſpect hath righteouſneſſe? How is God thruſt out, and every Idol, every vanity made a God? but the truth here, which the ſpirit teacheth, diſcovers all, pulls off the vayle, ſhewes us the true countenance and face of things, that we may not be deceived; ſhewes us vanity in riches, folly in honour, death and deſtruction in the pomp of this world; makes poverty a bleſſing, and miſery happineſſe, and death it ſelf a paſſage to eternity; placeth God in his Throne, and man where he ſhould be, at his footſtoole, bowing before him, which is the readieſt way to be lifted up unto him, and to be with him for evermore. In a word, a truth of power to unite us to our God, that brings with it the knowledge of Chriſt, the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

For if we make it our friend here, it ſhall then look lovely on us, and ſpeak good things for us; but if we deſpiſe it, and put it under our baſeſt deſires and vile affections, it will then fight againſt us, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over us, and tread us down into the loweſt pit.

There can be but one God, one Heaven, one Religion, one way to bleſſedneſſe, and there is but one Truth, and that is it which the <hi>Spirit</hi> teacheth; and this runs the whole compaſs of it, directs us not onely <hi>ad ultimum, ſed uſque ad ultimum,</hi> not onely to that which is the end, but to the means, to every ſtep, and paſſage, and approch, to every help and advantage towards it, and ſo unites us to this <hi>one God,</hi> gives us right to this <hi>one Heaven,</hi> and brings us home to that <hi>one end</hi> for which we were made. <hi>And is there yet any more?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes, particular caſes may be ſo many and various, that they cannot all come within the compaſs of this <hi>truth,</hi> which the ſpirit hath plainly taught; 'tis true, but then, for the moſt part they are caſes of our own making; caſes which we need not make, caſes ſometimes raiſed by weakneſs, ſometimes by wilfulneſs, ſometimes even by ſin it ſelf, which reignes in our mortall bodies, and to ſuch, this <hi>leſſon of the Spirit</hi> is as an Ax to cut them, off. But be their Originall what it will, if this truth reach them not, or if they bear no Analogy or affinity with that which the Spirit hath taught, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it by any evident and neceſſary conſequence, they are not to be reckoned in the number of thoſe which concern us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are aſſured that he hath led us into all truth that is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59296:57"/> ſpirituall wiſdome, which make this noyſe abroad, which rend the Church in pieces, and work this deſolation on the earth; it is the want of conſcience, the neglect of conſcience in the common and known wayes of our duty, which have raiſed ſo many needleſs <hi>caſes of conſcience,</hi> which if men had not hearkened to their luſts, had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhewn their head; had been, what indeed they are, nothing: the acts of charity are manifeſt, 1 Cor. 13. <hi>She ſuffereth long,</hi> even injuries and errours, but doth not riſe up againſt that which was ſet up to enlarge and improve her. <hi>Charity is not raſh</hi> to beat down eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that had its firſt riſe and beginning from Charity; <hi>is not puffed up,</hi> ſwells not againſt a harmleſs, yea, and an uſefull conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though it be of man. <hi>Doth not behave it ſelf unſeemly,</hi> layes not a neceſſity upon us of not doing that which lawful authority even then ſtyles an indifferent thing, when it commands it to be done. <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſeeketh not her own,</hi> treads not the publique peace under foot, to procure her own; <hi>Charity is not provoked,</hi> checks not at every feather, nor ſtartles at that monſter, which is a creation of our own: <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thinketh no evil,</hi> doth not ſee a Serpent under every leaf, nor Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry in every bow of Devotion; if we were charitable, we could not but be peaceable; if that which is the main of the Spirits leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, did govern mens actions, there would <hi>be abundance of peace ſo long as the moon endureth. Multa facienda ſunt non jubente lege, ſed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berâ charitate,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> Charity is free to do, &amp; ſuffer many things which the <hi>Spirit</hi> doth not expreſly command, and yet doth command in generall, when it commands and enjoyns obedience to Authority, which hath no larger circuit to walk and ſhew it ſelf in, than in things in themſelves indifferent, which it may enioyn for orders ſake, and the advantage of thoſe things which are <hi>neceſſary,</hi> which are already under a higher and more binding law, than any Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate or Monarch of the earth can make.

For how eaſy is it to a diſengaged and willing mind to apply a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall precept to particular actions? eſpecially if Charity fill our hearts, which is the bond of perfection, and the end and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Law, which indeed is our ſpirituall wiſdome? In a word, in theſe caſes, when we goe to conſult with our reaſon, we cannot erre, if we leave not Charity behind us; or if we ſhould erre, our charity would have ſuch an influence upon our errour, that it ſhould trouble none but our ſelves: for <hi>Charity

               <p>Now this promiſe was directly and primarily made to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, whoſe Commiſſion was extraordinary, even as large as the whole world, and therefore needed the ſpirits guidance in a more high and eminent manner; the gifts of Tongues, and diverſities of graces, which might fit them for ſo great a work, that as their care, ſo their power might be as univerſall as the world. And yet to them it was given in meaſure, and where meaſure is, there are degrees, for they were lead by degrees, not ſtreight to all truth, but by ſteps, and approches. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf was not wrapt up as his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſucceſſor into the chaire of truth, to determine all at once; for when pentecoſt was now paſt, he goes to <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> and there learnes more then he did at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſees that in the <hi>ſheet</hi> which was let down to the earth, which he heard not from the <hi>Tongues,</hi> and <hi>of a truth</hi> now perceived what he did not before, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.34. that <hi>God was no accepter of perſons,</hi> that now the partition-wall was broken down, that <hi>Jew</hi> and Gentile were both alike, and the Church, which was formerly ſhut up in <hi>Judea,</hi> was now become <hi>Catholique;</hi> a Body, which every one that would, might be a member of.</p>
               <p>Beſides, though the Apoſtles were extraordinarily and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly inſpired, yet we cannot ſay, they uſed no meanes at all to bring down the bleſſed Spirit; for tis plaine, they did wait for his coming, they did pray for the truth, they did labour for the truth, they did conferre one with another, met together in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, deliberated before they did determine; nor could they imagine they had the ſpirit in a ſtring, and could command him as they pleaſe, and make him follow them whitherſoever they were pleaſed to go. And then between us and the Apoſtles there is a maine difference, nor can we expect an ocular and viſible deſcent; and therefore if we will be taught by the ſpirit, we muſt uſe the meanes which the ſame ſpirit hath preſcribed in thoſe leſſons which he firſt and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily taught the Apoſtles, and not make uſe of his name to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpret
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59296:59"/> interpret thoſe leſſons which he taught, or bring in new of our own, and as new, ſo contrary to them; for what is new, muſt needs be contrary, becauſe he then taught all truth, and what is more then all, is nothing; what is more then all truth muſt needs be a lye.</p>
               <p>Nor did he <hi>lead them into all truth</hi> for themſelves alone, but for all thoſe who ſhould come after them, for all generations to the end of the world; he made them <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> ſent them to make us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to make that which he taught them, a rule of life, and to fix it on the Church as on a <hi>pillar,</hi> that all might read it, that none ſhould adde to it, or take away from it; and for this they are called a <hi>Foundation,</hi> Epheſ. 2.20 and we are ſaid to <hi>be built upon them</hi> (Jeſus Chriſt being the head corner-ſtone) which we could not be, if their teſtimony were ſo ſcant and defective, that there were left a kind of neceſſity upon us to hew and ſquare out what ſtones we pleaſe, and lay a new one of our own to caſt down theirs, and beare up whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our inſolent and boundleſſe luſts will lay upon it: And now whats become of my Text? for if this be admitted, we cannot ſay the <hi>ſpirit led them;</hi> for what leading is that, which leaves us ſo farre behind at ſuch a diſtance from the end, that in every age he muſt come againe, and take us by the hand, and draw us ſome other way, even contrary to that which he firſt made known? and what an <hi>all</hi> is that, to which every man may adde what he pleaſe, even to the end of the world? for every mans claim and Title to the ſpirit is the ſame, as juſt &amp; warrantable in any as in one; &amp; when they ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary things, the evidence is the ſame, that is, none at all, unleſs this be a good Argument, <hi>he hath the ſpirit, becauſe he ſayes ſo;</hi> which is as ſtrong on his ſide, that denyes it upon the ſame pretence: Amongſt the ſonnes of men there are not greater fooles then they, who have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay for what they ſay, but <hi>that they ſay it,</hi> and yet think this nothing enough, and that all Iſrael are bound to hearken to them, as if God himſelf did ſpeak.</p>
               <p>And this is an evil, a folly, a madneſſe, which breaths no where but in Chriſtendome, never heard of in any other body or ſociety, but that of Chriſtians; for though many Governours of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths did pretend to a kind of commerce and familiarity with ſome God, or Goddeſs, when they were to make a law; yet we doe not read of any (as farre as I remember) that did put up the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that they might break it; but when the law was once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulg'd, there was nothing thought of, but obedience, or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But Chriſtians who have the beſt Religion, have moſt abuſed it, have play'd the wantons in that light in which they ſhould have walkt with feare and trembling; and finding themſelves at loſſe, finding no ſatisfaction to their pride and ambition, to their malice, and luſts, from any leſſon the Spirit hath yet taught, have learnt an

I need not goe ſo farre back for inſtance. Our preſent age harh ſhewen us many who have been ignorant, yet wiſer then their Teachers, ſo ſpirituall, that they deſpiſe the word of God, which is the dictate of the ſpirit (for this monſter hath made a large ſtride from forreigne parts, and ſet his foot in our coaſts) If they murder, the ſpirit moved their hand, and drew their ſword; if they throw down Churches, it is with the breath of the Spirit; if they would bring in parity, the pretence is, the Spirit cannot endure that any ſhould be ſupreme, or Pope it but themſelves; our humour, our madneſſe, our malice, our violence, our implacable bitterneſſe, our railing and reviling muſt all go for <hi>inſpirations of the ſpirit; Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi, Abſolon</hi> and <hi>Achitophel, Theudas</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Ananias,</hi> they that deſpiſe the holy Spirit of God, theſe Scara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees bred in the dung of ſenſuality, theſe Impoſtors, theſe men of <hi>Belial</hi> muſt be taken no longer for a <hi>generation of vipers,</hi> but for the ſcholars and friends of the holy Ghoſt; whatſoever they do, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever they goe, He is their leader, though it be to hell it felf.</p>

                  </note> I might ſay that it is more dangerous than this: for to confeſs the Spirit, and abuſe him, to draw him to as an acceſſary and abettor, nay as a principall, in thoſe actions which nature it ſelf abhors and trembles at, is worſe than out of errour to deny him. For what a <hi>Spirit,</hi> what a <hi>Dove</hi> is that which breathes nothing but gall and wormwood? but fire and brimſtone? what a Spirit is that, which is ever pleading and purveying for the fleſh? what a Spirit is that which is made to bear witneſſe to a lie? for as <hi>Petrarch</hi> tells us, <hi>Nihil importunius erudito ſtulto,</hi> that there is not a more troubleſome creature in the world, than a <hi>learned foole;</hi> ſo the Church of Chriſt and Religion never ſuffered more than by carnall men, who are thus ſpirit-wiſe; for by acknowledging the Spirit, and making uſe of his name, they aſſume unto themſelves a licence to do what they pleaſe, and work wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, not onely with greedineſſe, but <hi>cum privilegie,</hi> with priviledge and authority; which whileſt others doubt of, though it be not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Error, but Blaſphemy, yet <hi>parciùs inſaniunt,</hi> they are not ſo outragiouſly made.</p>
               <p>But yet we muſt not put the ſpirit from his office, becauſe dreams, or rather the evaporations, of mens luſts do paſſe for revelations; or ſay he is not a leader into truth, becauſe wicked or fanatick perſons walk on in the wayes of Errour, in the wayes of <hi>Cain,</hi> or <hi>Corah,</hi> and yet are bold to tell the world, that this ſpirit goes before them.

But then thoſe inſpirations which bring in God to plead for <hi>Baal,</hi> which cry up Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to gain the world, which tread down peace and charity, and all that is praiſe-worthy under feet, to make way for mens unruly luſt, to pace it more delicately to its end; they that magnifie Gods will, that they may do their own; theſe men, theſe ſpirits cannot be from God: <hi>By their fruits you ſhall know them.</hi> For their hypocriſie, as well and cunningly wrought as it is, is but a poor cob-web-lawn, and we may eaſily ſee through it, even ſee theſe ſpirituall men ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and toyling for the fleſh, theſe ſpirits digging in the mineralls, and making haſte to be rich: for though <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> Glory be to God on High, he the <hi>Prologue</hi> to the Play, (for what doth an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite but play?) yet the whole drift, the buſineſſe of every Scene and Act is to draw and conclude all in this, <hi>From hence we have our gain.</hi> The Angel or the Spirit ſpeaks firſt, and is the <hi>Prologue</hi> and Mammon, and the Fleſh make up the <hi>Epilogue.

When I ſee a man rowl his eys, compoſe his countenance, order and methodize his geſture, as if he were now on his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, to take his leave of the world; when I hear him loud in Prayer, and as loud in reviling the iniquity of the times; when I ſee him ſtartle at a miſplaced word, as if it were a thunder-bolt; when I heare him cry as loud for a reformation as the Idolatrous Prieſts did upon <hi>Baal,</hi> I begin to think I ſee an <hi>Angel</hi> in his flight and mount, going up into heaven; but then after all this extaticall devotion, after all this zeal, and in the midſt of all this noyſe wherein I ſee
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59296:61"/> him ſtoop like the vultur, and flie like lightning to the prey, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſay within my ſelf, <hi>Oh Lucifer, ſon of the morning, how art thou fallen from heaven?</hi> how art thou brought down to the ground, nay to hell it ſelf? ſure I am the <hi>ſpirit of truth</hi> looks upward, moves upward, directs upward to thoſe things which are above; and if we follow him, neither our doctrine nor our actions will ever ſavour of this dung.</p>
               <p>So then, we ſee this inconvenience and miſchief, which ſometimes is occaſioned by this doctrine of the <hi>Spirits leading,</hi> is not unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; it is not neceſſary, though I miſtake, and take the Divel for an Angel of light, that the holy Ghoſt ſhould be put to ſilence; though <hi>Corah</hi> and his complices periſh in their gainſayings, yet God forbid that all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be ſwallowed up on the ſame gulph.

                  </gap>, a love of Induſtry, for if we love it, it will be alwayes in our thoughts, and we ſhall meditate of it day and night; for to love ſeven yeares are but a few dayes, and great burdens are but ſmall, and labour is but pleaſure, and we walk in the region of truth, viewing it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in it, gathering what may be for our uſe; we walk in it as in a Paradiſe. Truth is beſt bought when it coſts us moſt, and muſt be wooed oft and ſeriouſly, and with great devotion; as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſaid of the gods, <hi>Non eſt ſalutanda in tranſitu,</hi> is not to be ſpoken with in the By and paſſage, is not content with a glance and ſlutation, and no more; but we muſt behold it with care and anxiety, we muſt make a kind of peregrination out of our ſelves, and muſt run and ſweat to meet it, and then this ſpirit leads us to it. And this great encouragement we have, that in this our labour we never faile of the end we labour for; which we cannot find in our other endeavours and attempts, in which we have nothing to uphold us under thoſe burdens which we lay upon our own ſhoulders, but a deceitful hope, which carries us along to ſee it ſelf defeated, the fruſtration whereof is a greater penalty and vexation than that which we undertook for its ſake. How many riſe up early to be rich, and before their day ſhuts up are beggers? how many climb to the higheſt place, and when they are neer it, and ready to fit down, fall back into a priſon? But in this we never faile, the Spirit working with us, and bleſſing the work of our hands, making our buſie and carefull thoughts as his chariot, and then filling us with light; ſuch is the priviledge and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of Induſtry, ſuch is the nature of Truth, that it will be wrought out by it; nor did ever any riſe up early, and in good earneſt travell towards it, but this ſpirit took him by the hand and brought him to his journeys end. <hi>If thou ſeekeſt her as ſilver,</hi>

               <p>You will ſay perhaps, that the Spirit is an omnipotent Agent, and can fall ſuddenly upon us, as he did upon the Apoſtles this day; that he can lead us in the way of truth, though we ſit ſtill, though our

               <p>In this Chapter, and indeed in every Chapter of this Epiſtle, our Apoſtle hath made this diſcovery to our hands: Some there were, as he obſerves, that placed it in the ear; did hear and not do: and reſted in that: ſome did place it in a formall devotion: <hi>did pray, but pray amiſſe,</hi> and therefore did <hi>not receive:</hi> ſome that placed it in

               </p>
               <p>Not that we exclude <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Prayer,</hi> or <hi>Hearing</hi> of the Word; for without faith religion is but an <hi>empty</hi> name, and it comes by hearing, and is increaſed by devotion.

                  </note> ſo is faith the Foundation of an Holy Converſation, in this we edifie our ſelves, and in this we ſuſtain and uphold others, in this we ſtand, and in this we raiſe up others; From faith are the <hi>iſſues</hi> of life, from <hi>this,</hi> as from a fountain flow thoſe waters of comfort, which refreſh the widow, and fatherleſſe, and that <hi>water of ſeparation,</hi>

               <p>But our Apoſtle mentions none of theſe, and I will give you ſome reaſon; at leaſt, a fair conjecture, why he did not. And
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59296:66"/> firſt, not Faith, we ſee here where he tells us what Pure Religion is, he doth not ſo much as name it; for indeed, it is the ground of the whole draught and portrayture of Religion, and as we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it in Pictures it is in ſhadow; not expreſt, out yet ſeen: ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by Saint <hi>James,</hi> writing not to Inſiders, but to thoſe who had already given up their names unto Chriſt. And it is like thoſe <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

In the ſixth to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls it a principle of the Doctrine of Chriſt: and what neceſſity was there for my Apoſtle to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that unto them which they already embraced, to direct them in that in which they were perfect, to urge that which they could not deny; not deny? nay, of which they made their boaſt all the day long? No: Saint <hi>James</hi> is for <hi>Ostende mihi,</hi> he doth not once doubt of their faith, but is very carneſt to force it out, that it may evaporate, and ſhew it ſelf in their works of piety: Then faith is a ſtarre, <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.19.</note> and when it ſtreams out light, and the beams are the works of charity: Then faith is as a ſhip, when <hi>Pure Religion</hi> is the rudder to ſteer and guide it, that it daſh not on a rock, and ſhip-wrack: Then faith is the ſoul of the ſoul, when by its quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and enlivening power we run the wayes of Chriſts command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: <hi>pure creduat, pure ergo loquantur,</hi> faith the Father: Their belief is right, therefore let their converſation be ſincere, no other concluſion can naturally be deduced from faith, and of it ſelf it can yeeld no other, and this it will yeeld, if you do not in a manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, and ſpoyle it of its power and efficacy; for what an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall inconſequence is this, I beleeve that Chriſt hath taught me, to be mercifull, as my heavenly Father is mercifull: That cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity hath the promiſe of the world to come, Therefore I will ſhut up my bowels; this I am ſure is one part of our belief, if it be not, our Creed is moſt imperfect; and yet ſuch practicall concluſions doth our avarice and luxury draw. Our faith is ſpread about the world, but our charity is as a candle under a buſhell; the great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and folly of this our age, which can ſhew us multitudes of men and women, which, as the Apſtle ſpeaks, are <hi>ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth,</hi> which have con'd their Creed by heart, but have little skill, or forgot their skill they have, in the royall Law; who cry up faith as the <hi>Jews</hi> did the Temple of the Lord, and are very zealous for it, yet ſuffer it to decay and waſte, till it be dead, as my Apoſtle ſpeaks, cat out the very heart of it, by a careleſſe and prophane converſation, as the <hi>Jews</hi> with their own hands did ſet fire on that Temple. which they ſo much adored.</p>
               <p>And this may be a ſecond reaſon, why he mentions not faith in his character of Religion; for having every where preacht up the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59296:66"/> power and efficacy of faith, men carnally minded did ſo fill their thoughts, with the contemplation of that fundamentall vertue, that they left no roomfor other vertues, not ſo efficacious indeed to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a ſinner, yet as neceſſary as faith it ſelf: did commend &amp; extol the power of faith, when it had none at all in them, nay, (which is the moſt fatall miſcarriage of all) did make it an occaſion, <note place="margin">Rom. 6.6.</note> through which ſinne revived, which ſhould have deſtroyed in them the whole body and juncture of ſin; it being common to men at laſt to fix and fettle their minds upon that object which is moſt often preſented to their mindes, as the Countrey peaſant having heard much talk of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> began at laſt to think there was no other City but that: If we look forward to the ſecond Chapter of this Epiſtle, we ſhall think this more then a conjecture; for there he ſeems to take away from faith its ſaving attribute, <hi>Numquid fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des poteſt ſalvmn ſacere?</hi> Can faith ſave a man? What an Heretick, what a Papiſt would he be, that ſhould but put up this queſtion in theſe our dayes? wherein the <hi>ſola juſtificat</hi> hath left faith alone in the work of our ſalvation: and yet the queſtion may be put up, and the reſolve on the negative may be true; It cannot ſave him certainly that ſaith he hath faith, and hath not works: And thus, though he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute indeed againſt <hi>Simon</hi> the ſorcerer, and others, as we may gather out of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> yet in appearance he levels his diſcourſe againſt <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle: for <hi>not by works, but by ſaith,</hi> faith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> not <hi>by faith,</hi> but <hi>by works,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>James,</hi> and yet both are true, the one ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were all for the Law the other to thoſe who were all for faith, and to them who had buried all thought of good works in the pleaſing but deceitfull contemplation of faith, he ſpeaks no other language, but <hi>do this;</hi> and exalts charity to the higher place, that their vain boaſting of faith might not be heard; for faith, ſaith he, hath no tongue, nay, no life without her, and thus in appearance he takes from the one, to eſtabliſh the other, and ſets up a throne for charity, not without ſome ſhew, and ſemblance of prejudice to faith.</p>
               <p>For laſt of all, to give you one reaſon more: Faith indeed is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally productive of good works: For what madneſſe is it to ſee the way to eternity of bliſſe, and not to walk in it? Each article of our Creed points out, as with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If I beleeve that Chriſt is God, it will follow, I muſt worſhip him: If he died for ſinne, the conſequence is plain enough, we muſt die to it: If he ſo loved vs, the Apoſtle concludes, we muſt love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: charity is the proper effect of faith, and upon faith, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity we build up our hope, if we beleeve the promiſes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the condition, if we beleeve him that loved us, and love him, and keep his commandments, we are in heaven already. But yet we may obſerve, that the corruption of our hearts findes ſomthing in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59296:67"/> faith it ſelf, to abate and weaken her force, and power, and to take off her activity, and ſo makes the very object of faith an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to evil, and (which is a ſad ſpeculation) the mercy of God, a kinde of temptation to ſinne: Mercy is a pretious oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and mercy breaks our head; mercy blots out ſin, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy revives it; mercy is our hope, and mercy is made our confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: we ſhould ſin no more, but we ſin more and more, becauſe his mercy endureth for ever: we turn the grace of God into wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and make this Queen of his glorious attributes to wait on our luſt: of a Covering, a purging, a Healing, a ſaving, (I tremble to ſpeak it) we make it a damning mercy; for had we not abuſed it, had we not relied upon it too much, had we not laid upon it all our uncleanneſſe, our impenitency, and wilfull obſtinacy in ſinne, it would have upheld us, and lifted us up as high as Heaven; but our bold preſumption layes hold of it, and it flings us off, and we fall from it, into the bottomleſſe pit.</p>
               <p>This then we may take for a ſufficient reaſon, why our Apoſtle puts not faith into his deſcription of Pure Religion, and in the next place, as he doth not mention faith, ſo he paſſeth by in ſilence, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then forgets thoſe other excellent duties of prayer, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word.</p>
               <p>For theſe two, whatſoever high eſteem we put upon them; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we magnifie them till they are nothing, till our ſelves are worſe than nothing, worſe than the beaſts that periſh, yet are they not the end; and their end is perdition, who make them ſo, and think that to aske a bleſſing is to have it, when they put it from them: or to hear of God is to love him: to hear of that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which he hath laid up, is to be in Paradiſe. The perfection of the creature, ſaith the Philoſopher is <hi>ad naturae ſuae ſinem perve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire,</hi> to attain to the end for which he was made, and the end of the Chriſtian is, to be like unto Chriſt, that where he is, He may be alſo; that is his end, that is his perfection: Now to draw this home, theſe two, to Hear and to Pray; do not make us like unto him, but are ſufficient means to renew the image of God in us, that ſo we may reſemble him, they are not the haven to which we are bound, but are as proſperous and advantagious windes to carry us to it, <hi>Quod per ſe bonum eſt, ſemper eſt bonum,</hi> that which is good in it ſelf, and for it ſelf, is alwayes good, as true piety, true Religion, but thoſe duties which tend to it, have their reward or puniſhment as they reach, or miſſe of that end; what is hearing, if it beget not obedience? what are prayers if they be but the calves of our lips?

               <p>We muſt therefore ſearch out another world: and you need not travell far, <note place="margin">1 <hi>ep.</hi> 2.16.</note> for you may ſtay at home, and finde it in your ſelves; S. <hi>John hath</hi> made the diſcovery for you in his firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, where he draws the map of it, and divides it to our hands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three provinces or parts; the firſt, the luſt of the fleſh, where unlawfull pleaſures ſport themſelves; ſecondly, the luſt of the eyes, where covetouſneſſe builds her an houſe; thirdly, and the pride of life which whets a ſword for the Revenger, erects a throne for the Ambitious, raiſeth up a triumphant Arch for the vain-glorious; this is the world, ſaith S. <hi>John,</hi> even a world of wickedneſſe; this inverteth the whole courſe of Nature, makes the <hi>wheel</hi> of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation move diſorderly; this world within us, makes that world without us an enemy; makes beauty deceitfull, wine a <hi>mocker,</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches a <hi>ſnare</hi> works that into ſinne, out of which, we might have made a key to open the gates of Heaven; drops its poyſon under every leaf, upon every object, and by its mixture with the world, ingenders that ſerpent, which ſpets the poyſon back again upon us, and not onely beſpots, <note place="margin">James 1.15.</note> and defiles, but ſtings us to death: for <hi>when Luſt hath conceived it bringeth forth ſinne, and when ſinne is fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed</hi> it defiles a man, and leave thoſe ſpots behinde it, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face him, and gives him a thouſand ſeverall ſhapes; the <hi>Schools</hi> call it <hi>maculam peccati</hi> the blot and ſtain of ſinne, which is of no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive reality, but a deprivation, and defect of beauty in the ſoul, and varies, as ſhadows do, according to the diverſity of thoſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59296:69"/> that caſt it. We ſee then, that there is a world within us, as well as without us, and when theſe two are in conjunction, when our luſt joyns it ſelf to the things of this world, as the prodigall is ſaid to do to a maſter in a farr countrey, then follows pollution and deformity, and as many ſpots, as there be ſins, which are as many as the hairs of our head; Beauty brings in deformity, riches poverty, plenty brings leanneſs into the ſoul; and therefore to conclude this, to keep our hearts with diligence, and to keep our ſelves unſpotted of the world, is a main and principall part of our Religion, and will keep us members of Chriſt, and parts of the Church, when prophaneneſſe, and coverouſneſſe, which is Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſhall have laid her diſcipline, her honor in the duſt: A man of tender bowels and a pure heart is as the Church; and <hi>the gates of hell</hi> cannot prevail againſt him. By this we imitate that God we worſhip, we draw neer unto him, as neer as fleſh and morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity will permit; our eſcaping the <hi>ſpots</hi> and pollutions of this world makes us followers of that God, who marks every ſpot we have, and is not touched, ſees us in our blood and pollution and is not defiled, beholds all the wickedneſſe in the world, and yet remains the ſame for ever, even goodneſſe and purity it ſelf; this makes us partakers, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of the Divine nature, in a word, <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4.</note> to be in the world and tread it under our feet, to be in <hi>Sodom,</hi> and to be a <hi>Lot,</hi> on the hills of the robbers, and do <hi>no</hi> wrong, to be in the midſt of ſnares and not be taken; to be in Paradiſe, <note place="margin">Import.</note> and ſee the Apple pleaſant to the ſight, to be compaſt about with glorious objects of delight and pleaſures, and not to <hi>Taſte</hi> or <hi>Touch</hi> or <hi>Handle,</hi> is the neereſt aſſimilation that Duſt and Aſhes, that mortall man can have to his Creator.</p>
               <p>I may well then call theſe two the Eſſentiall parts of Religion: <note place="margin">Antigoni Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>For firſt, to viſit the Fatherleſſe and widdows, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in good works, <hi>iſta ſunt quaſi incunabula pietatis</hi> ſaith <hi>Gregory,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Auguſtin.</note> theſe are the very beginings and nurcery of the love of God, and there is no ſurer, and readier ſtep to the love of God whom we have not ſeen, then by the love of our Brethren whom we ſee; <note place="margin">Gregor.</note> 
                  <hi>Tunc ad alta charitas mirabiliter ſurgit, cum ad ima proximorum ſe miſericorditer attrahit,</hi> Then our charity begins to improve itſelf, and riſe as high as Heaven, when it bowes and deſcends, and falls
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59296:70"/> low, to ſit with a Brother in the Duſt; and if you ſearch the Scriptures, if you look over Chriſts Sermon on the Mount, you will eaſily be induced to beleeve, that the greateſt ſervice we can do to God, is to ſerve one another in love, who made us all, and to this end; <hi>alterutra diligentia charitatis,</hi> as <hi>Tertul.</hi> calls it; This mutual and reciprocal work of charity in upholding each other, is that which makes us indeed the ſervants of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as compaſſion to our Brethren is a fair preparation to purity of life, ſo doth purity of converſation commend our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, and makes it to be had in remembrance in the ſight of the Lord; Compaſſion in a prophane, impure perſon, is but a ſudden forced motion, is but by fits and ſtarts, for ſure it cannot ſtay, and dwell in ſuch a ſty. He that wallows in the pleaſures of this world, he that devotes himſelf to riot and luxury, cannot gain the title of religious by ſome cup of cold water, ſome peece of mony, which he gives; He that gathers by oppreſſion, and then lets fall an Almes, doth but ſteal an Oxe to make a Sacrifice, <hi>perdere ſcit,</hi>

Thus to viſit the fatherleſs and widows, and to reach out that hand unto them, which is ſtained with the blood of others, is not pure and undfiled Religion, it may be Bread, 'tis not an Almes, that is brought by the Hand <hi>of an</hi> Oppreſſor, or Phariſee.</p>
               <p>And therefore in the next place, as they bear this fair corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence and mutually uphold each other, ſo we muſt not think it poſſible to ſeparate them. For ſome there be who come on ſlowly to the works of charity, becauſe they are not guilty of thoſe ſins, <note place="margin">Greg.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59296:70"/> which are made with hands: And this is a common fault amongſt Chriſtians; to think the performance of one part of our Duty to be an Apologie for the neglect of the other, and that the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of ſome few precepts, will abſolve us from the breach of the reſt, that a ſigh is louder then an oath, and can ſooner call down a pardon, then the flying Book can bring a curſe; that the diligence of the Eare will anſwer for the boldneſs of the Hand: That a Faſt will make Sacriledge a Virtue, and the keeping of the ſeventh Day, acquit us of thoſe ſins which we have reſolved already to corumit in the other ſix.</p>
               <p>Indeed ſaith <hi>Baſil,</hi> it is a great deal eaſier to do nothing at all, then to finiſh and perfect a good work. Thou ſhalt not kill, Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery, Thou ſhalt not ſteal, Thoſe are Negative precepts, and require but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

               <p>For in the next place, theſe two thus linkt and united together, will keep Religion <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>undefiled,</hi> which I told you were as the colours and beauty of it; the Beauty of Holineſs, which hath its colour and Grace, from whence it hath its being and ſtrength, and if it be true, will ſhine in the perfection of Beauty.

               <p>And now I have ſhewed you the picture of Religion in little, <note place="margin">The Ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> repreſented it to you in theſe two; Doing of Good, and abſtaining from Evil; filling the hungry with good things, and purging, and emptying our ſelves of all uncleanneſs; you have its beauty in its Graceful and Glorious Colours of Purity and Undefiledneſs, <hi>Dignum Deo ſpeciaculum,</hi> a picture to be hung up in the Church, nay, before God himſelf; for thus it appears <hi>Coram Deo &amp; Pare</hi> before God and the Father, and hath its ratification from Him.

Behold, and look no farther, God the Father hath made a Religion, which is pure and undefiled to our hands; and therefore as <hi>Seneca</hi> counſels <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius;</hi> when thou wouldſt forget all other things, <hi>Cogita Caeſarem,</hi> entertain <hi>Caeſar</hi> in thy thoughts; ſo that we may forget all other ſublimary, worldly, I may ſay, Helliſh Religions, let us think of this Religion, whoſe Author and Founder is God, whoſe wiſdom is infinite, whoſe power uncontrolable, whoſe authority unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable; for talk what we will of authority, the authority of man is like himſelf, and can but binde the man, and that the frai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt and earthlieſt part of him, only God is <hi>Rex mentium</hi> the King of our mindes, and no authority in Heaven, or in Earth, can binde or looſe a Soule but his, who firſt breathed it into man; Come then let us worſhip and fall down before <hi>God the Father,</hi> the maker both of us, and our Religion.</p>
               <p>Again in the ſecond place, if Saint <hi>James</hi> be Canonical, and Authentick, if this be true Religion, then it will make up an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſufficient to ſtop the mouth of thoſe of the Romiſh party, who are very buſie to demand at our hands a catalogue of Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, and where our Church was before the dayes of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

And again do they, who meaſure Religion rather by the pomp and ſtate it carries with it, then the power and majeſty of the Author, whoſe command alone made it Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ask us, where our Religion was in the dayes before there was a withdrawing from the Communion with that Church, we may anſwer; it was here in the Text; for <hi>haec eſt</hi> this is it; and if they further queſtion us, where it was profeſſed, we need give no other reply then this; it was profeſt, where it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt; if it were not proteſt in any place, yet was it true Religion, for the truth depends not on the profeſſion of it, nor is it leſs truth, if none receive it; but profeſt it was even amongſt them, in the midſt of them, round about them; but whereſoever it were, <hi>Haec erat,</hi> this was it, this was true Religion before God and the Father, <hi>to viſit the Fatherleſs and Widows in their Affliction, and to keep our ſelves unſpotted of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude then. <note place="margin">Concluſ. 3.</note> Men and Brethren, are theſe things ſo? and is this only true Religion to doe good and abſtain from evil? what a buſie noiſe then doth the world make for Religion, when it offers it ſelf and falls ſo low, offers it ſelf to the meaneſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the narroweſt capacity, and throws it ſelf into the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of any that will love it; <hi>Littus Hyla, Hyla, Omne ſonabat,</hi> Religion is the talke of the whole world, it is preach't on the houſe tops, and it is cryed up in the ſtreets, we are loud for it, and ſmother it in that noiſe, we write for it, and leave it dead in that letter, to be found no where but in our books; we fight for it, and it is drowned in the blood that is ſpilt; and Saint <hi>James</hi> his, that is, Chriſts Religion is little thought of, but trampled under foot in the quarrel: For if this ſhould take place amongſt the ſons of men, we ſhould have more religion and leſs noyſe; for <hi>haec eſt,</hi> this is it, which alone is able to ſlumber this noiſe, to ſtill the raging of the Sea, and the tumults of the people: This would ſtay the hand of the ſcribe to write leſs, and to more pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; This would break the Bow, and cut the Spears, and burn the Charriots with fire: Could this Religion, Could the Goſpel of Chriſt prevail; Could we deny our ſelves, and take up the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59296:73"/> Croſs, and keep our ſelves unſpotted from the world, there would be then no wars, nor rumurs of wars: Let us not deceive our ſelves; it is the neglect and want of this, that hath been the main cauſe of all theſe hot contentions and digladiations which have been, and as yet are in the Church of Chriſt, I mean amongſt thoſe who call one another Chriſtians, whoſe mark and badge it is, to love one another, but they lie one to another, and love the world, and in a baſe but fierce emulation juſtle one another out of it, and ſo loſe the thing, and retain nothing but the name, which is leſs then a ſhadow, rejoyce together at the news of a Saviour, and neglecting this Religion in the Text, are all loſt, are diſciples of Chriſt, but ſuch diſciples as ſhall be puniſhed with more ſtripes then they that never heard of his name. This, this is it, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the world; that makes it an Aceldama, a field of blood, as Hell it ſelf, full of confuſion; for if men had been careful to walk by the ſame rule, which was as plain and manifeſt, as if it had been written with the Sun-beams, and kept themſelves in a joynt obedience to this Religion, to thoſe truths wherein they could not but agree, and not ſought out many inventions, the ſeed-plots, and nurſeries of contention and debate, (for from hence they ſpring, and here they will grow, and grow thick, and multiply) if our Religion had been pure and undefiled, it had ſaved many a poor carkas from the fire; and I may be bold to ſay, many a ſoul from Hell; and though mens opinions in other matters had been as different as their ſhape and complexion, yet their agreement in the known duties of Religion, would have been a Fence and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark ſtrong enough, to have kept contention from breaking in with fire and ſword. But when Ambition and Covetouſneſs and other low and vile reſpects had taken poſſeſſion of the hearts of men, then matter of Religion, became matter of Faction, and the fuel of that fire, which conſumed many, but troubled all: then began men to rack the Scriptures, to make them ſpeak what they would have them, even that which might dilate their phylacteries, and ſtretch forth the Curtains of their Habitation, and feed that noxious humour in them which was moſt predominant, and like thoſe Souldiers in Tacitus <hi>malle victoriam, quam pacem,</hi> to deſire not peace, but victory; though moſt times, which ſide ſoever prevailed, it was not ſo much againſt an adverſe party, as the truth it ſelf. This hath been a great, nay, the greateſt evil under the Sun, and hath brought in ſo many Religions into the world, that many men are not as yet well reſolved which to chuſe, the Divels ſubtileſt engine to bring in at laſt an opinion, that there is none at all.</p>
               <p>By this you may ſee of what ſoveraign uſe my Text is, even as a pretious balm, which can ſo eaſily allay the ſwelling, and raging controverſies, with which the Church is ſo much troubled, (as

And may not God be the ſame upon the like occaſions? How many millions of righteous perſons have been thus delivered, whoſe names notwithſtanding are no where recorded? ſome things of no great worth are very famous in the world, when many things of better worth lie altogether buried in obſcurity <hi>caruerunt quia vale ſacro,</hi> becauſe they found none who could or would tranſmit them to poſterity. <hi>Vixere fortes ante Agamemnona,</hi> no doubt, but before and ſince millions have made the like eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capes, though their memory lies rak'd up, and buried in oblivion.</p>
               <p>But then, ſuppoſe the righteous do taſte of the ſame cup of bitterneſſe with the wicked, yet it hath not the ſame taſte and reliſh to them both, for calamity is not alwayes a whip, <note place="margin">Calamitas non eſt poena, militia eſt minus.

Why ſhould the <hi>Philiſtine</hi> boaſt himſelf in his miſchief? <hi>the goodneſſe of God endureth yet dayly,</hi> and is every day, <note place="margin">Pſal. 51.2.</note> and in every age the ſame, and it is no concluding argument, that we pleaſe God. when we are imployed in the puniſhment of thoſe that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, nor can we thus argue, no more then we can attribute reaſon, and wiſdom to an <hi>Aſſe,</hi> becauſe it pleaſed God once to

               <p>Secondly, it gives light to the <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> by which he may or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſteps, with more caution and warineſſe; For as our Saviour ſayes we may make a friend of Mammon, and Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> adds even of the Devil himſelf, ſo may a true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> make a friend of a <hi>Philiſtine,</hi> and they who ſurvive, may learn by the 34000. who were ſlain, who being dead, yet ſpeak unto them and us, to fly from the wrath of God, who when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell againſt him, can puniſh us by far worſe then our ſelves. Oh, who would not look upon thoſe ſins, as the moſt horrid ſpectacles in the World, for the puniſhment of which, God ſhould cull out ſuch inſtruments, that are under a greater curſe, fitter for the fire then thoſe on whom they are uſed? If we go on and continue in ſin, <note place="margin">Joel 2.25.</note> God may ſend out his <hi>great Army</hi> againſt us, his Graſhoppers, his Cankerworm, and his Caterpillar, and eat up our Harveſt; <note place="margin">Habbac. 2.11.</note> He may raiſe up every Creature, even the <hi>timber out of the wall</hi> to ſpeak againſt us; and if we ſtill ſtand out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, he may raiſe up ſome accurſed Alien, ſome <hi>Philiſtine,</hi> ſome childe of Perdition to wreak his vengeance upon us; who would not be afraid of that cup of bitterneſſe, which muſt be brought to him by the hand of a <hi>Philiſtine?</hi> and forſake ſin, if not for the puniſhment, yet for the executioner? A ſad ſight it was to ſee <hi>David</hi> the Father whipt for his Adultery, by his Son, and <hi>David</hi> the King chaſtiſed by his Subject, who ſhould have kiſt his Feet; <note place="margin">2 Sam. 16.11.</note> (he himſelf ſaies, <hi>The Lord bid him doe it</hi>) to ſee a whole Nation carried away Captive by a <hi>man,</hi> who did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards degenerate into a <hi>Beast,</hi> to ſee ſo many thouſand <hi>Iſraclites</hi> fall at the feet of Idolaters, and ſervants of <hi>Dagon;</hi> but the inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is indeleble, what is writen, is written, <hi>Dominus est,</hi> it is the Lord.</p>

               <p>For we may obſerve in theſe <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> what (if we could be impartial) we may ſoon diſcover in our ſelves in the uſe of thoſe helps, which God hath graciouſly afforded us: They both ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and diſhonored the Ark, gave it too high an eſteem, and yet undervalued it, they called it their God, and made it their Idol. A ſtrange contradiction: yet ſo viſible in the courſe and progreſſe of carnal worſhippers, that he that ſees them in their race, would think they ran two contrary wayes at once were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Religious, and very profane, at once did invade Heaven with violence, and yet drive furiouſly to the loweſt pit.</p>
               <p>And firſt, we have juſt reaſon to imagine, that when the Ark was taken up upon the <hi>Levites</hi> ſhoulders, and they ſang <hi>let God ariſe</hi> (which was the ſet and conſtant form) they ſpake not by metaphor, but as if indeed they had their God on their ſhoulders: for in the fourth Chapter, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſmitten at the 2. ver. let <hi>us bring ſay they, the Ark of the Covenant,</hi> at the third: The Ark is brought out, and now victory is certain, for <hi>when it cometh
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59296:81"/> amongst us, it willſave us ſay they.</hi> But, as <hi>Epictetus</hi> once taught his Scholars, that they ſhould ſo behave themſelves, that they might be an Ornament to the Arts, and not the Arts unto them; ſo the integrity of the <hi>Jew</hi> ſhould have been a defence to the Ark, and not the Ark made uſe of, to ſtand up for a prophane impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent <hi>Iſraelite.</hi> For what a wile, and ſophiſme of Satan is this, to perſwade a polluted ſinful ſoul, that when he hath ſcornfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the ſubſtance; (that piety which ſhould make him ſtrong in the Lord) at the laſt, in the time of Danger, and the furious approach of the enemy, a ſhadow ſhould ſtand forth, and fight for him; that when he had broken the Law and Teſtimonies, not regarded the Oracles, forget all the Mercies of God, and robd him of his glory, that then, I ſay, the ſhell, the Ark, the <hi>Shittim wood</hi> ſhould be as the great power of God to maintain his cauſe: certainly, if this be not a wile of the Devil, I know no ſnare he hath, that can catch us: if this be not to deceive our ſelves, I ſhall think there is no ſuch thing, as error in the World,</p>
               <p>But again in the ſecond place, and on the contrary, as they did <hi>Deificare Arcam,</hi> as the father ſpeaks, even deifie the Ark, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute more unto it, then God ever gave it, or was willing it ſhould have; ſo they did alſo <hi>depretiare</hi> vilifie, and ſet it at naught: called it their ſtrength, their glory, their God, but imployed it in baſer offices then ever the Heathen did their gods, who called upon them, to teach them, to ſteal and deceive: Not long ſince their Prieſts committed rapes at the door of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, <note place="margin">Pulcra laverna, Da mihi falle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re &amp;c.

Oh, the Ark, the Ark, <hi>the glory of God,</hi> that is able to becalm, and ſlumber a Tempeſt, to binde the hands of the Almighty, that he ſhall not ſtrike; to ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an Army; to make kings to fly, to crown a ſinful Nation with victory, to bring back an adulterer <hi>Lanreate,</hi> a Raviſher with the ſpoiles of a <hi>Philiſtine,</hi> that ſhall be a buckler, a protection to defend them, who but now defiled it; that ſhall be their God, which they made their Abomination: bring forth the Ark and then what are theſe uncircumciſed <hi>Philiſtines?

That we muſt waſh, and eat, are Commands, but which bring no Burden, or hardſhip with them, the performance of them being more eaſie, as no whit repugnant to fleſh and blood; It is no more, but waſh and be clean, Eat in remembrance of the Greateſt Benefit, that ever man-kinde received. All the difficulty is in the performance of the vow, we make in the one, and the due preparation of the ſoul for the other, which is the ſubduing of the luſts, and Affections, the Beatifying of the inward man, which is truely, and moſt properly the ſervice of Chriſt, which is the Ark of our Ark, the Glory of our Glory, and the Crown of all thoſe outward Advantages, which our Lord and Maſter hath been pleaſed to afford us; <note place="margin">Mic. 6.6.</note> we may ſay with the Prophet <hi>Micah, wherewith ſhall we come before the Lord? or bow our ſelves before the High God?</hi> will he be pleaſed with the diligence of our ear, with our Waſhing and Eating, and anſwer with him at the eighth verſe: <hi>He hath ſhewed thee oh man,</hi>

               <q>
                  <p>As you have received, &amp;c.</p>
               </q>
               <p>In the handling of the firſt, we ſhall point, and levell our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe at theſe <hi>two particulars.</hi> 1. Shew you, That Chriſtianity is not a lazy, idle Profeſſion, a ſitting ſtill, or ſtanding, a ſpeculation, but a walke. 2ly, Wherein this <hi>walke</hi> or motion principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts. And firſt, we find no word ſo expreſſive, no word more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed in holy Writ then this, To <hi>walke with</hi> God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16. To <hi>walk before</hi> God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.40. to <hi>walke by Faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. To <hi>walke in</hi> good Works, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. and in divers other places; For indeed, in this one word, in this one ſyllable, in contained the whole matter, the end and ſumme of all; All that can be brought in, to make up the perfect man in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>For firſt; This brings forth a Chriſtian, like a Pilgrim, a Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, <hi>forgetting what is behind,</hi> and weary of the place he ſtands in, counting thoſe few approaches he hath made as nothing, ever pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſtriving, gaining ground, and preſſing forward to a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degree, to a better place; As there is <hi>motus ad perfectionem,</hi> a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to perſection; ſo there is <hi>motus in perfectione,</hi> a motion, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe even in perfection it ſelf; the good Chriſtian being ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and never perfect till he come to his journeys end.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It takes within its compaſſe all thoſe eſſentiall requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites to action. 1. It ſuppoſeth faculty to diſcover the way. 2ly, A power to act, and move in it. 3ly, <hi>Will,</hi> which is nothing elſe, but <hi>principium actionis,</hi> as <hi>Tert.</hi> calls, the beginning of all motion, the Imperiall power, which as Queen commands, and gives act to the underſtanding, ſenſes, Affections, and thoſe faculties which are ſubject to it; And beſides this, to <hi>walke,</hi> implies thoſe outward and adventitious helps; Knowledge in the underſtanding, and love in the Will, which are as this Pilgrims ſtaffe, to guide and uphold him in his way; his knowledge is as the day to him, to walke as in the Day, and his Love makes his journey ſhorter, though it be through the wilderneſſe of this world, to a City not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59296:88"/> made with hands, nor ſeen. For faculty without knowledge, <note place="margin">Hebr. 11.</note> is like <hi>Polyphemus,</hi> a body with power to move, but without eye-ſight to direct, and therefore cannot chuſe but offend and move amiſſe; and faculty and knowledge without love, and deſire, are but like a Body, which wanting nouriſhment, hath no ſenſe of hunger to make it call for it, and therefore cannot but bring leanneſs into the ſoul: For be our naturall faculty and ability what it will, yet if we know not our way, we ſhall no more walk in it, then the Traveller ſound of body and limbe can goe the way aright, of which he is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ignorant; Againe, be our Abilities perfect, and let our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge be abſolute, yet if we want a mind, and have no love, if we ſuffer our ſelves to be over-ſwayed by a more potent affection to ſomething elſe, we ſhall never doe, what we know well enough, and are otherwiſe enabled to. Now to walk in Chriſt takes in all theſe: Faculty, Power, Will, Knowledge, Love; Then you ſee a Chriſtian in his walk, rejoycing as a mighty man to run his race, when the Underſtanding is the Counſellor, and points out; This is the way, walk in it; and the will hath an eye to the hand; and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the underſtanding, bows it ſelf, and as a Queen drawes with in thoſe inferior faculties, the ſenſes and Affections, when it opens my eye to the wonders of Gods Law, and ſhutts it up by cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the vanity of the world; when it bounds my touch and taſt, with Touch not, Taſt not any forbidden thing; when it makes the ſenſes as windows to let in life, not death, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.21. and as gates ſhut faſt to the world, and the Devill, and lifting up their Heads to let the King of Glory in, when it compoſeth, and tuneth our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to ſuch a Peace, and Harmony, ſetting our love to piety, our anger to ſinne, our feare to Gods wrath, our hope to things not ſeen, our ſorrow to what is done amiſſe, and ſo frameth in us, <hi>nunc modulos Temperantiae, nunc carmen pietatis,</hi> as Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeakes, now the even meaſures of Temperance, now a Pſalm of piety, now the Threnody of a broken heart, even thoſe Songs of <hi>Sion,</hi> which the Angels in heaven, and God himſelf delight in; and all theſe are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually included in this one word, to <hi>walk</hi> in Chriſt, and if any of theſe be wanting, what proffers ſoever we make; what fancies ſoever we entertaine, what empty conceptions ſoever we foſter, yet fleſh and blood cannot raiſe it ſelf on theſe wings of wind, nor can we be more ſaid to walk, then they who have been dead long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe.</p>
               <p>For ſo farre is the bare knowledge of the way from advancing us in our walke, that it is a thing ſuppoſed, and no where under the command, as it is meerly ſpeculative, and ends in it ſelf; no more then to ſee, or <hi>feele,</hi> or heare, and ſo eſſentiall is this motion of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Chriſtian, that in the language of the Spirit wee are never truely ſaid to know, till wee walke, and that made imperfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which receives thoſe things, which concern our peace, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59296:89"/> then the eye doth colours, or the eare ſounds; never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once named or mentioned in the Scripture, but with diſgrace; <hi>If any man ſay, I know him, and keep not his Commandements, he is a lyar.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.4. ſo that to define our walking by Knowledge and ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, is a kind of Hereſy, which rather deſerves an <hi>Anathema,</hi> and ſhould be drove out of the Church with more zeal and earneſtneſs, then many, though groſſe, yet ſilly, impertinent errors, which p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſe abroad about the world, but under that name.</p>
               <p>For 1. this ſpeculative knowledge is but a naked aſſent, and to more, and hath nothing of the will: and the underſtanding is not an arbitrary faculty, but neceſſarily apprehends objects in that ſhape and form they repreſent themſelves; nor is it deceived, even when it is deceived (I mean in things which concern our walk) for the bill and accuſation againſt us, is not, that we doe not, but that we will not underſtand; <hi>nolumus intelligere ne cogamur &amp; facere,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aug.</hi> we wilnot know our way, for no other reaſon, but becauſe we are moſt unwilling to take the paines, and walk in it. And therefore in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chriſtian peripatetique, there muſt be ſomething of the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin,</hi> and ſomething of the <hi>Cherubin,</hi> there muſt be heat, as well as light, love as well as knowledge: for love is active, and will pace on, <note place="margin">Hugo de San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto vict.</note> where Knowledge doth but ſtand at gaze, <hi>Amor intrat, ubi cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitio foris ſtat,</hi> love is active, and will make a battery, and forcible entrance, and take the Kingdom of heaven by violence, whilſt Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation ſtands without, and looks upon it, as in a Map. What talke we of knowledge and ſpeculation? It is but a look, a caſt of the mindes eye, and no more, and doth but place us, as God did <hi>Moſes</hi> once upon mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> to ſee that ſpirituall <hi>Canaan,</hi> which we ſhall never enjoy; and then what comfort is it, to know what Juſtification is, and to want that hand of a quick and active faith, which alone can lay hold on Chriſt? to talke of Election, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make it ſure? to diſpute of Paradice, and have no title to it? to ſpeak of nothing more, then Heaven, and be an heire of Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And then, what a fruitleſſe mock-knowledge is that, which ſets God a <hi>walking,</hi> whilſt we ſleep and dreame? makes the Maſter of the Vineyard work, and ſweat, and ſtands idle it ſelf all the day long? which hath a full view of what God hath done before all Time, and no power at all to move us, to do any thing in this our day? when we are well ſeen in the Decrees of God, and little move in our own Duties? when we can follow God in all his ways, and tell how he worketh in us, and are afraid of that feare and trembling, with which we ſhould work out our Salvation? can ſpeak largely of the Power of Gods Grace, and reſiſt it? of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and fall more then ſeven times a day? This knowledge, I ſay, is but a bare aſſent, and ſo far from being enjoyn'd us, that, as the caſe now ſtands, ignorance were the ſafer choice; and rather then thus to know him, we may ſay with the Apoſtle, Let him that is <hi>ignorant,</hi>

                  </gap>f minde, a faint velleity, a forc'd involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry approbation, which we would ſhake off, if we could, as we do a friend which ſpeaks what we would not hear, and calls that poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which is as Honey to our taſt: For who can ſee ſuch ſights, and not in ſome degree be taken with them? Who can look upon the Temple, and not ask, what Buildings are theſe? who can ſee the way to life, and not approve it? but you know, I may purpoſe to riſe; and yet fold my hands to ſleep? I may commend the way, and not walke in it: Nay, how often do we pray, Give us ever of this Bread of life, and yet labour moſt for this bread that periſheth; which we at once revile and embrace, and ſpeak evill of it, becauſe we love it, when heaven is but as a Picture, which we look upon, and wonder, and refuſe, and hath no better place of reception, then that common Inne of all wild, and looſe imaginations, the fancy? <hi>Chriſt is the way:</hi> it is in every mans Creed; and if this would make us walkers, what a multitude of Sectaries? what a Herd of Epicures? what an aſſembly of Atheiſts? what a congregation of fools? I had almoſt ſaid, what a Legion of Devills might goe under that name? For even the Devills themſelves have acknowledged Chriſt, and this way is not evill ſpoken of, nay, it is magnifyed of them who had rather wallow in the mire, then walk in it: How is Chriſt made not onely <hi>panis quotidianus,</hi> our daily Bread, but <hi>ſermo quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianus,</hi> the talk of every day and houre? In our miſery we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his help; In his Name we lie down, and in his Name we riſe up, In his Name we Propheſy: if afflictions beat upon us, he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon to calme the ſtorme? If our conſcience chide us, we have learnt an unhappy art and skill to force him in to make our Peace? We love to talke of him, we many times leave our neceſſary cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and trades moſt unneceſſarily, but to heare of him: but all theſe may be rather proffers, then motions, rather pleaſing and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering thoughts, then painfull ambulations, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf, in his Confeſſions, <note place="margin">Confeſſ. l. <hi>8.</hi> c. <hi>5.</hi>

               <p>And this is a principal mark of a true Chriſtian, of a man dwelling in Chriſt, that he wholy flings himſelf into his Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he here ſixeth his hope, and doth not buſie himſelf to finde any ſhelter, but here; for as the full perſwaſion of the Almighty power of God was the firſt riſe to Religion, the fountain from which all worſhip whether true or falſe did flow, (for without this perſuaſion there could be none at all) and we finde this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on his power not onely rewarded, but magnified in <hi>Scripture,</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, he worketh a ſincere, and real obedience in that heart in which he dwells, and this is proper to the true Chriſtian; For
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59296:103"/> the actions of an hypocrite are not natural, but artificial, not the actions of a living ſoul, but like unto the motions of that Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial body, which <hi>Albertus made,</hi> not proceeding from any life in them, but forced as it were by certaine wheeles, and Engines, by love of a good Name, by feare of ſmart, or hope to bring their purpoſes about, and thus many times he walks to his end in the habit of a Saint, when no other appearance will ſerve; but where Chriſt dwells, there is his ſpirit, and where his ſpirit is, there is truth, and he faſhioneth and ſhapeth out our affections to the things themſelves, makes our affections ſuch, as ſo faire an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject requires; that as his promiſes, ſo our affections are yea, and <hi>Amen,</hi> that as his reward is real, ſo is our love to it real, as the Goſpel and Heaven and Chriſt is true, ſo are our affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them hearty and ſincere; <hi>true as he is true, and faithful as he is faithful.</hi> So then (to conclude this) Chriſt dwelleth in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true Chriſtian, not as a contracted, or divided Chriſt, as the Antient Hereticks made him, but dwells, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, fully and plentifully in him. Secondly, he dwells in him as Chriſt yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame for ever; not as <hi>Baal,</hi> now preent with us, and anon aſleep; Laſtly, he dwelleth in him, not as <hi>Marcion</hi> blaſphemed, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

For doth ſhe not in a manner tell us, that within her Territories we are ſafe upon what tearms ſoever we ſtand with Chriſt, and though we dwell in Chriſt, that is, perform all Chriſtian duties, yet if we dwell not in her, be not incorporated with her, our faith, our hope, all our endeavours are in vain, and ſo inſtead of a Church, have ſet upoan Idol, as great an Idol as they have made the <hi>Virgin Mary;</hi> For the one as well as the other muſt go for a mother of mercy. And do we not with grief behold it ſo in other factions, though as diſtant from this, as the Eaſt is from the Weſt? do they not meet in this, to count all goats, that are not within their fold; to leave no way to happineſſe, but in their company; do not they look upon their condition, as moſt deplorable, who do not caſt in their lots with them, who are not of the ſame collection, and diſcipline, of their fraternity, which they call the Church of Chriſt, why ſhould men thus flatter themſelves? tis not our joyning to this particular Church, or that new fancied, and new gathered Congregation, but our dwelling in Chriſt, our eating his fleſh, and drinking his blood, our feeding on, and digeſting his Doctrine, and Growing thereby, can make us Chriſtians, and as an unneceſſary ſeparating my ſelf from; ſo an uncharitable, and ſupercilious uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

For, I conceive, there is no policy, no diſcipline ſo eſſential to the Church, as piety, as our obedience to Chriſt. Suppoſe I were in a wilderneſſe? did my ſoul lie, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>amongſt Lions,</hi> yet might I dwell in Chriſt: be the government and outward policy what it will; nay, be there but a ſlender appearance of any, yet might I dwell in Chriſt; nay, did perſecution ſeal up the Church doors, and leave no power to cenſure inordinate livers; were there no more left then a <hi>dic fratri,</hi> tell it to thy brother between thee and him, yet could I dwell in Chriſt, elſe why was their faith commended, <hi>who wandered up and down in Sheep-skins, and Goat-skins, in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts and Mountains, in Dens, and Caves of the earth?</hi> but then, <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> if we dwell not in Chriſt; if we do not love him, and keep his Commandements, I cannot ſee, what Church, what Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can be a Sanctuary to ſhelter us, and our crying the Church, the Church, will be but as the <hi>Jews</hi> crying the Temple, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>of the Lord, but as the ſound of braſſe, or tinkling of a Cymbal,</hi> a ſad knell, and fearful ſigne and indication of men departed from Chriſt, and caſt out of doors, being dead in their ſins.

Do they not pleaſe themſelves, and commit folly in their own ſouls; where Pride mixeth and ingendereth with covetouſneſſe and worldly reſpects, and begets malice, debate, envy, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting, perſecution, let us then take heed of this; of this root of bitterneſſe, that beareth gall and worm-wood, and let us watch over our ſelves, that we embrace not a name, for a thing, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, for a Church, our humour, and fancy for Chriſt, and that we do not ſo joyn our ſelves with others, that we loſe our hold, and place in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And therefore in the laſt place, let us make a ſtrickt ſurvey, let us impartially commune with our own hearts, and ſee how we have held up the relation between Chriſt and us, whether we can

Our admiring his Majeſty, our loving his command, our relying on his protection, and reſting under the ſhadow of his wing: Again, our enſe, and feeling of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit of Chriſt, by the practick efficacy of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the actuation and quickning of our faith, and the power of it, working a univerſal, conſtant, ſincere obedience, theſe are the chariots, which Chriſt ſends to carry us out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> unto our ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial <hi>Canaan,</hi> and when we feel theſe, and by a ſweet and well gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned experience feel the power of them in our ſouls; then we draw neer in full aſſurance; then we ſhall joy fully cry out with <hi>Jacob;</hi> it is enough: then we ſhall know, that our <hi>Joſeph</hi> is alive, and that Chriſt doth dwell, and live in us of a truth.</p>

                  <p>And therefore, if the will <hi>Turne,</hi> all theſe will <hi>Turne</hi> with it, <hi>Turne</hi> to their proper offices and Functions.

Let your Anger kindle againſt an Enemy; and it is a Fury, that Torments two at once; but derive it, and lay it on your ſin, and there it ſits as a Magiſtrate on a Tribunall, to worke your Peace. That ſorrow, which wee caſt away upon Temporall loſſes, is a Diſeaſe, which muſt be cured by <hi>Time,</hi> but our ſorrow for ſinne, is a Cure it ſelf, is a ſecond Baptiſme; waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es away the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of that Evill, and dyes with it, and riſes up againe in Comfort. That joy which is rays'd out of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and Pleaſure, is rais'd as a Meteor out of dung, and is whiffed up and downe, by every winde and Breath; but if it follow the Health and Harmony, the good Conſtitution of the Soule; it is as cleare, and pure, and conſtant, as the Heavens themſelves, and may be carried about in a laſting and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gyre, but is ſtill the ſame.

                  <p>We cannot Think, that in this our <hi>Turne,</hi> the Powers of the Soul are pull'd to pieces, that our Affections are plucked up by the roots; That our <hi>Love</hi> is <hi>Annihilated,</hi> our <hi>Anger</hi> deſtroyed, our <hi>Zeal</hi> quencht; By my Turne, I am not diſſolved, but better built, I have new Affections, and yet the ſame; now dead, and impotent to evill, but vigorous and active in Good; my ſteps are altered, not my Feet, my Affections cut off; the Character is chang'd, but not the Book.

                  <p>For it is eaſy to obſerve, That the ground of all deſpaire is not from hence; That we <hi>cannot,</hi> but that we <hi>will not</hi> Turne, which much reſembles that <hi>Deſpaire,</hi> which chaines the damned Spirits in the place of torment; ſo farre we are like to them, that we deſpaire for want of Charity, which they can never have, nor the deſpairing Sinner (as he thinks) and therefore will not have: not for want of Faith, which they have, as well as he, and tremble: we deſpaire not, I ſay, for want of Faith; For 'tis plaine, If we did not beleeve, we could not Deſpaire, unleſſe, peradventure, we doe, with ſome, conceive of Faith, as that Inſtrument or habit, by which we do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and appropriate Chriſts Merits, and Promiſes to our ſoules, which indeed is rather an Act of our <hi>Hope,</hi> then of our Faith; <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire</hi> being nothing elſe, but the diſability of applying Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to our ſelves, which is the effect, not of Infidelity, but ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

Thus may our ſinnes goe over our heads, and over thoſe Mercies too, which might be over our ſinnes, and make us very witty to argue and diſpute againſt our ſelves; even diſpute our ſelves into Hell: A neglect of our Duty begate Deſpaire, and Deſpaire baſely improves, and augments our neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; and if we judge rightly, our <hi>non poſſe</hi> is a <hi>nolle,</hi> we cannot <hi>turne,</hi> becauſe we will not <hi>turne;</hi> for if we would but <hi>turne</hi> (which we may if we will) Deſpaire would ſink and vaniſh out of ſight, and mercy would ſhine forth through this cloud, and give light e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to fly farre from that evill, the feare of which had cover'd our faces, and in a manner buryed us alive: for a Deſpairing man is but a dead carcaſſe, actuated not by a ſoule, but a Devill.

                  <p>And this is the proper and Natural effect of mercy, to give ſight to the blinde, that they may ſee, to binde up a broken limb that it may move: and to raiſe us from the dead, that we may walk, to make us good, who were evil: For this is ſhines in brightneſſe upon us every day, not onely to enlighten them, who ſit in darkneſſe, but many times the <hi>children of light</hi> themſelves, who though they ſit not in darkneſſe, yet may be under a cloud, raiſe up, and ſetled in the brain, not from a corrupt, but a tender, and humble Heart. For we cannot think that every man that ſayes he deſpairs, is caſt away, and loſt; or that our erroneous Judgement of our ſtate, and condition, ſhall be the rule, by which God will proceed againſt us, and Judge us at the laſt day; that when we have ſet our hearts to ſerve him, and have been ſerious in all our wayes, when we have made good the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>i. e.</hi> our part of the Covenant, as far as the Covenant of Grace, and the equity and gentleneſſe of the Goſpel doth exact it, he will refuſe to make good his part, becauſe we cannot think well of our ſelves, and though we have done, what is required, perſwade our ſelves that we are fallen ſo ſhort in the performance of our duty, that we ſhall never reach to the end; in a word; that he will forbear to pronounce the <hi>Euge well done,</hi> becauſe we are afraid, and tremble at all our works, or put us by and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject us after all the labour of our charity, for a melancholly fit, or condemn the ſoul, for the diſtemper of the body or ſome perturbation of the minde, which he had not ſtrength enough to withſtand, though he were <hi>ſtrong in the Lord;</hi> and in the power of his ſpirit did cheerfully run the wayes of his Commandements. It were a great want of Charity thus to Judge of thoſe, whoſe troubleſome, and moſt afflicting errour was conceived and formed in the very bowels of charity.</p>
                  <p>For ſometimes it proceeds from the diſtemper of the body, from ſome indiſpoſition of the brain, and if we have formerly
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59296:124"/> and do yet ſtrive to do him ſervice, he is not ſo hard and auſtere a Maſter, as to puniſh us <hi>for being ſick.</hi> Sometimes it ariſes from ſome defect in the judicative faculty, through which, as we make more Laws to our ſelves, and ſo more ſins then there are; ſo we are as ready to paſſe ſentence againſt our ſelves, not onely for the breach of thoſe Laws, which none could binde us to, but our ſelves; but even of thoſe alſo, which we were ſo careful to keep; for as we ſee ſome men ſo ſtrong, or rather ſo ſtupid, that they think, they do nothing amiſſe; ſo there be others (but not many) ſo weak, or rather ſo ſcrupulous, that they cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves, that they ever did any thing well. This is an infirmity and diſeaſe, but it is not Epidemical. The firſt are a great multitude, which 'tis hard to number, <hi>quocunque ſub axe</hi> they are in every Climate, and in every place, but moſt often in the Courts of Princes, and the habitations of the <hi>Rich,</hi> who can do evil, but will not ſee it, who can make the <hi>loud condemnation of a fact,</hi> and the <hi>bold doing it,</hi> the buſineſſe of one, and the ſame hour; almoſt of one and the ſame moment: The other are not many, for they are a part of that <hi>little Flock,</hi> and the <hi>good Shepherd</hi> will not drive them out of the fold, for the weak conceit they had, that they had gone too far aſtray. For errour is then moſt dangerous and fatal, when we do that which is evil, not when we ſhun and fly from it, as from the plague, and yet cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, we are removed far enough from the infection of it.</p>
                  <p>And therefore (again) it may have its Original not onely from the Acraſie and diſcompoſedneſs of the outward-man, or the weakneſſe in Judgement, or that ignorance of their preſent eſtate (which may happen to good men, even to thoſe, who have made ſome fair proficiency in the School of Chriſt; and to which we are very ſubject amidſt that variety of circumſtances, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, and multiplicity of thoughts, which riſe and ſink, and return again, and ſtrangle one another, to bring in others in their place) but it may be brought in by our very care and diligence, and an intenſive love: For care, and diligence, and love, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes followed with fears and jealouſies: love is ever a beginning, till all be done, and is but ſetting out, till ſhe be at her journeyes end. The liberal man is afraid of his Almes, and the Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate miſtruſts his abſtinence; the meek man is jealous of every heat: <hi>pietas etiam tuta pertimeſcit,</hi> piety is afraid even of ſafety it ſelf, becauſe it is piety, and cannot be ſafe enough. And if it be a fault thus to undervalue himſelf, it is a fault of a fair extraction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten not by <hi>blood</hi> or the <hi>will of men,</hi> not by negligence, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and the pollutions of the fleſh, but of care and anxiety, and an unſatisfied love, which will ſometimes demur, and be

Every man hath not a place and manſion in Heaven, that pretends a Title to it; nor is every man ſhut out, that doubts of his evidence. This diffidence in our ſelves is commonly the mark and Character of a Good man, who would be better; and though he hath built up his aſſurance as ſtrong as he can, yet thinks himſelf not ſure enough, but ſeeks for further aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and fortify's it with his <hi>Feare,</hi> and aſſiduous diligence, that it may ſtand faſt for ever, whereas we ſee too many draw out their owne Aſſurance, and ſeale it up with unclean Hands, with wicked hands, with hands full of Blood.</p>
                  <p>We have read of ſome in the dayes of our Fore-fathers, and have heard of others in our own, and no doubt many there have been, of whom we never heard, whoſe Converſation was ſuch as became the Goſpel of Chriſt, and yet have felt that hell within themſelves, which they could not diſcover to others, but by gaſtly looks, Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryes, and deep Groanes, and loud complaints to them who were neere them; That Hell it ſelf could not be worſe, nor had more Torments, then they felt: And theſe may ſeem to be breath'd forth, not from a broken, but a periſhing heart; to be the very Dialect of Deſpaire; and indeed ſo they are, for Deſpaire, in the worſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cannot ſink us lower then hell: But yet we cannot, we may not be of their opinion, and think (what they ſay) that <hi>they are caſt out of Gods ſight;</hi> No, God ſees them, looks upon them with an Eye full of compaſſion, and moſt times ſends an Angel to them, in this their Agony, as he did unto Chriſt, a meſſage of Comfort to rowſe them up; but if their tenderneſſe ſhould yet raiſe doubts, and draw the cloud ſtill over them; we have reaſon to think (and who dares ſay the contrary?) that the hand of Mercy may, even through this cloud, receive them to that Sabbath and <hi>reſt, which remaines for the people of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſpeak of men, who have been ſevere to themſelves, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in this their Warfare; full of good works, and continued in them: and, who have many times, when they were even at the gates of heaven, and neere unto happineſſe, theſe Terrors and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightments, who are full of Charity, and therefore cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of hope, although their owne ſad apprehenſions, and the breathings of a Tender Conſcience have made the operation of it leſſe ſenſible, and their hope be, not like <hi>Aarons</hi> rod, cut off, dryed up, and utterly dead; but rather like a tree in Winter, in which there is life and faculty, yet the abſence of the Sun, or the cold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numming

                  <p>The Caſe then of every man that Deſpaires, is not deſperate; but we muſt conſider diſpair in its <hi>Cauſes,</hi> which produce and work it. If it be exhal'd and drawn up out of our corrupt works, and a pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Conſcience, the ſtreame of it is poyſonous, and deleteriall, the very ſmoake of the bottomleſſe pit; but if it proceed from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the body (which ſeiſes upon one, as well as another) or a weakneſs of Judgement (which befalls many, who may be weak, and yet Pious) or an exceſſive ſollicitude, and tenderneſſe of ſoul (which is not ſo common) we cannot think, it can have that force and malignity, as to pull him back, who is now thus ſtriving to enter in at the narrow gate, or to cut him off from ſalvation, who hath wrought it out with <hi>Feare and trembling.</hi> At the Day of Judgement, the Queſtion will be, not what was our Opinion, and conceit of our ſelves, but what our converſation was, and what we thought of our Eſtate, but what we did to raiſe it? not of our fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed application of the Promiſes, but whether we have performed the Condition; For then the Promiſes will apply themſelves; God hath promiſed, and he will make it good: we ſhall not be askt what we thought, but what we did? for how many have thought themſelves ſure, who never came to the knowledge of their Error, till it was too late? How many have called themſelves Saints, who have now their portion with Hypocrites?

                  <p>For this bold and groundleſſe preſumption of pardon makes us like unto him; hardens our heart firſt, and then our face; and carries us with the ſwelling ſailes of impudence, and remorſleſnes, to an extremity of daring, to that height of impiety, from which we cannot ſo eaſily deſcend, but muſt fall, and break and bruiſe our ſalves to pieces: <hi>praeſumptio inverecundiae portio,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tert.</hi> prſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a part and portion, and the upholder of immodeſty: and falls, and cares not whither: ruins us, and we know not how; abuſes and diſhonours that mercy, which it makes a wing to ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow it, and hath been the beſt purveior for ſin and the kingdom of darkneſſe.

For at the very name of Mercy, at the ſound of this Muſique, we lie downe and reſt in Peace; It is Mercy that ſaves us, and we wound our ſelves to death with Mercy: And as he that lookes upon the Sun with a ſteady eye, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves his eye, hath the Image of the Sun preſented almoſt in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry object; ſo when we have long gazed on the <hi>Mercy-ſeat,</hi> our eye begins to dazzle, and <hi>Mercy</hi> ſeems to ſhine upon us in all our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and at all times, and in every place. We ſee Mercy in the Law quite aboliſhing and deſtroying it, ſilencing the many <hi>woes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt ſinners. When we ſinne, Mercy is ready before us; That we may do it with leſſe regret; That no worme may gnaw us; when our Conſcience chides, Mercy is at Hand, to make our Peace. And this in the time of Health; and when our ſtrength fayleth, and ſickneſs hath laid us on our Bed; we ſuborne, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt it to give us a viſit then, when we can ſcarce call for it; to ſtand by us in this Evil day, when we can doe no good, that we may die in Hope, who had no Charity; and be ſaved by that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> whom we have Crucifyed: And as it falls out ſometimes with men of great Learning and Judgement, who can reſolve every doubt, and anſwer the ſtrongeſt Argument and objection, yet are many times puzzled with a peece of Sophiſtry; ſo it is with the formal Chriſtian; He can ſtand out againſt all motives and Beſeechings, and all the Batteries of God; all his <hi>Calls,</hi> and <hi>Obteſtations</hi> againſt the Terrors of Hell, and ſweet allurements of his Promiſes, but is ſhaken and foyled with a Fallacie, with the Devills Fallacie; <hi>à Dicto ſecundum quid, ad Dictum ſimpliciter.</hi> That Mercy doth ſave ſinners that Repent; and Therefore it ſaveth all; and upon this Ground, which glides away from us: upon this reaſon, which
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59296:129"/> is no Reaſon, the pleaſures, which are but for a ſeaſon, ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with us, when heaven with its bliſſe and eternity cannot move us, and the trouble which Repentance brings to the fleſh, ſhall affright us from good, more then the torments which are eternal can from ſin.</p>
                  <p>And therefore to conclude: Let us <hi>fear the mercy of God,</hi> ſo fear it, that it may not hurt us; ſo fear it, that it may embrace us on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſide; ſo fear it, that it may ſave us in the Day of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Let our ſong be made up, as <hi>Davids</hi> was of theſe diſcords, Mercy and Judgement. Let us ſet and compoſe our life by Judgement, that we may not preſume, and <hi>Turn</hi> our fear by Mercy, <note place="margin">Pſal. 101.1.</note> that we may not <hi>deſpair:</hi> remember we were Priſoners, and remember we were Redeemed: Remember we were weak and impotent; and remember we were made whole; Remember what Chriſt hath done for us, and remember what we are to do for our ſelves, and ſo work out our <hi>ſalvation with fear and trembling,</hi> and then <hi>draw neer with a true heart, in full aſſurance of faith to the throne of Grace;</hi> that Gods Wiſdom and Juſtice, and Mercy may guide us in all our wayes, till they bring us into thoſe new Heavens, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſſe, where God ſhall be glorified in us, and we glorified in him to all eternity.</p>

                     <p>For againe; every man is not equally inclin'd to every ſinne: This man loves that, which another loathes, and he who made the Devil fly at the firſt Encounter, may entertaine him at a ſecond: he that reſiſted him in luſt, may yeeld to him in Anger: He who will none of his delicates, may fayle at his Terrors, and he that feared not the roaring of the Lyon, may be enſnared by the flattery of the Serpent. For the force of Temptations is many times quickned, or Dull'd according to the Naturall Conſtitutions, and ſeverall complexions of men, and other outward Circumſtances, by which they may work more coldly, or more vehemently upon the will, and Affections. A man of a dull and Torpid diſpoſition is ſeldom Ambitious; a man of a quick and active Spirit, ſeldome Idle; the Cholerick man not obnoxious to thoſe evills, which melancholly doth hatch; nor the Melancholick to thoſe, which Choler is apt to produce: As hard a matter it may be for ſome men to commit ſome one ſinne, as it is for others to avoid it; as hard a matter for the <hi>Foole</hi> in the Goſpel to have ſcattered his Goods, as it was for the other <hi>Foole</hi> the <hi>Prodigall</hi> to have kept them; as hard a matter for ſome to let looſe their Anger, as it is for others to curbe and bridle it: ſome by their very temper and Conſtitution, with eaſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand luſt, but muſt ſtruggle and take paines to keep down their Anger: Some can ſtand upright in Poverty, but are overthrown by wealth: ſome can reſiſt this Temptation by ſlighting it; but muſt beat and macerate themſelves, muſt uſe a kind of violence before they can overcome another, which is more ſutable, and more flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters their Conſtitution: And this we may find by thoſe darts, which we caſt at one another, thoſe uncharitable Cenſures we paſſe: For how do the Covetous condemne and pity the Prodigal? and how doth the Prodigal loath and ſcorne the Covetous? How doth the Luke-warme Chriſtian abominate the Schiſmaticque, and the Schiſmaticque call every man ſo, if he be not as mad as himſelf? How doth this man bleſs himſelf, and wonder, that any ſhould fall into ſuch or ſuch a ſin; when he that commits it, wonders as much, that he ſhould fall into the Contrary? For the Enemy applies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to every Humour, and Temper, and having found where every man lies open to invaſion, there ſtrives to make his Battery, where every man is moſt aſſaultable, and there enters with ſuch forces,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59296:147"/> which we are ready to obey: with a ſword, which the Revenger will ſnatch at; with Riches, which the Covetous will digge for; with a diſh of dainties, which the Glutton will greedily devour, and what bait ſoever we taſte of, we are in his Snare; he hath his ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Darts, and if any one pierce the heart, he is a Conqueror: For he knows the wages of any one ſinne unrepented, is death. We are indeed, too ready to flatter, and comfort our ſelves in that ſinne, which beſt complies with our Humour, ever more to favour and Pardon our ſelves in ſome ſinne or other, and to make our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to one precept an Advocate to plead for us, and hold us up in the breach of another; <hi>I am not as other men are,</hi> there are more Phariſees then one that have ſpoke it. Some ſinne or other there is, either of Profit, or pleaſure, or the like, to which by Complexion we are inclin'd, which we too oft diſpenſe with, as willing it ſhould ſtay with us (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> confeſſes of himſelf, that when he prayed againſt Luſt, he was not very willing to be heard, or that God ſhould too ſoon divorce him from his beloved ſinne) At the ſame time we would be Good, and yet evill; we would partake of life, and yet joyne with that, which tends unto death: we would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, and yet wantons; we would <hi>Turne</hi> from one ſin, and yet cleave faſt to another. Oh let me Hugg my <hi>Mammon,</hi> ſaith the Miſer, and Ile defy luſt: let me take my fill of love, ſaith the wanton, and Ile ſpurn at Wealth: Let me waſh my feet in the blood of my enemies, ſaith the Revenger, and all other pleaſure I ſhall look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and loath: I will faſt and pray, ſaith the Ambitious, ſo they may be wings to carry me to the higheſt place, where I had rather be, then in heaven it ſelf. Every man may be induced to abſtaine from thoſe ſinnes, which either hinder not, or promote that, to which he is carried by the ſwindge of this naturall Temper, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: And as every Nation (in the times of Darkneſs) had its ſeverall God, which they worſhipt, and neglected others; ſo every man almoſt hath his beloved ſinne, which he cleaves to, and rather then he will <hi>Turne</hi> from it, will fling off all reſpect, and familiarity to the reſt; will abſtaine from evill in this kind, ſo he may take in the other, which is pleaſant to him; will be for God, ſo he may be for <hi>Baal</hi> too; will not <hi>Touch,</hi> ſo he may <hi>Taſt,</hi> will not look on this <hi>forbidden Tree,</hi> ſo he may pluck and Taſt of the other: And this is to ſport and pleaſe our ſelves in that evill way, which leads to Death; For what though I ſcape the Lion, if the Beare teare me in peeces? what is it to leane our hand, and reſt upon the forbearance of ſome ſinnes, if a Serpent bite us? what is it to <hi>Turne</hi> from many ſinnes, and yet be too familiar with that, which will deſtroy us? <hi>Saul,</hi> wee know, ſpared many of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> when Gods command was, to put all to the ſword, and the event was; he ſpared one too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for one of them was his Executioner; God bids us deſtroy the whole <hi>Body</hi> of finne, to leave no ſinne reigning in our <hi>mortall Bodies,</hi>
                        <pb n="167" facs="tcp:59296:147"/> and if we favour and ſpare but one, that one, if we <hi>Turne</hi> not from it, will be ſtrong enough to <hi>Turne</hi> us to Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>For againe; It is Obedience onely, that commends us to God, and that, as exact, and perfect, as the equity of the Goſpel requires, and ſo every degree of ſinne is rebellion: God requires <hi>totam volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> the whole will <hi>for indeed)</hi> where it is not whole, it is not at all, it is not a will, and <hi>integram poenitentiam,</hi> a ſolid, entire, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Converſion. True Obedience, ſaith <hi>Luther, non tranſit in genus deliberativum,</hi> doth not demurr and deliberate, I may add, <hi>non tranſit in genus judiciale,</hi> doth not take upon it ſelf to determine, which Commandement is to be kept, and which may be omitted; what in it is to be done, and what is to be left undone. For as our Faith is imperfect; if it be not equall to that Truth which is revealed; ſo is our obedience imperfect, when 'tis not equall to the command, and both are unavailable, becauſe in the one we ſtick at ſome part of the Truth reveal'd, and in the other come ſhort of the command; and ſo in the one diſtruſt God, in the other oppoſe him: what is a ſigh, if my murmuring drown it? what is my Devotion, if my Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence chill it? what is my Liberality, if my uncleanneſs defile it? what are my Prayers, if my partiall obedience turne them into ſinne? what is a morſell of bread to one poore man, when my op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion hath eaten up a Thouſand? what is my Faith, if my malice make me worſe then an Infidell? The voice of Scripture, the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Obedience is; to keep all the Commandements; the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Repentance, to depart from all Iniquity. For all the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in the world cannot waſh off the guilt of one unrepented ſin; <hi>Shall I give my firſt-born for my Tranſgreſsion,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, the fruit of my body, for the ſinne of my ſoule? ſhall I bring the merits of one Saint? the ſupererogations of another? and add to theſe the Treaſure of the Church? ſhall I bring my Almes, my Devotion, my Teares; all theſe will vaniſh at the guilt of one ſinne, and melt before it, as the wax before the Sun: for every ſinne is, as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Alexanders,</hi> in killing <hi>Caliſthenes, Crimen aeternum,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Sen. de Benef.</note> an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance can redeeme; For, as oft as it ſhall be ſaid, that <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> ſlew ſo many thouſand <hi>perſians,</hi> it will be reply'd, he did ſo, but withall, he ſlew <hi>Caliſthenes.</hi> He ſlew <hi>Darius,</hi> 'tis true, and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſthenes</hi> too: He wan all, as farre as the very Ocean; 'tis true, but he killed <hi>Caliſthenes;</hi> and as oft we ſhall fill our mindes, and flatter our ſelves with the forbearance of theſe, or thoſe ſinnes, our Conſcience will check and take us up, and tell us; but we have continued in this, or that beloved ſin, and none of all our performances ſhall make ſo much to our comfort, as one unrepented ſinne ſhall to our Reproach.</p>

                     <p>And now becauſe in common eſteeme, one is no number, and we ſcarce count him guilty of ſin, who hath but one fault; Let us well weigh the danger of any one ſinne; be it <hi>Fornication, Theft</hi> or <hi>Covetouſneſſe,</hi> or the like, be it whatſoever is called ſinne; and though, perhaps, we may dread it the leſſe, becauſe it is but one, yet we ſahll find good reaſon to <hi>Turne</hi> from it, becauſe it is ſinne.</p>
                     <p>And firſt: Every particular ſinne is of a monſtrous aſpect, being committed not onely againſt the Law written; but againſt the Law of Nature, which did then Characteriſe the ſoule, when the ſoule did firſt enforme the Body: for though we call thoſe horrid ſinnes <hi>unnaturall,</hi> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks againſt in the 1. to the <hi>romanes,</hi> yet in true eſtimation, every ſin is ſo, being againſt our very Reaſon, which is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

If Heaven were to be bought with ſin, it were no Purchaſe, for by every evill work, I forfeit not onely my Chriſtianity, but my manhood; I am robb'd of my chiefeſt Jewel, and I my ſelf am the Theef. Who would buy eternity with ſinne? who would buy Immortallity upon ſuch loathed Termes: If Chriſt ſhould have promis'd Heaven upon condition of a wicked life, who would have beleeved there had been either Chriſt or Heaven? And therefore it is laid as an imputation upon man, <hi>Solum hoc animal Naturae fines tranſgreditur,</hi> no Creature breaks the bounds and limits which Nature hath ſet, but Man; and there is much of Truth in it; man, when he ſinnes, is more unbounded, and irregular then a Beaſt. For a Beaſt follows the conduct of his naturall Appetite, but man leaves his Reaſon behind, which ſhould be more powerful, and is as naturall to him as his ſenſe. Man, ſaith the prophet <hi>David, that underſtands not, is like to the Beaſts that periſh;</hi> and Man that is like to a Beaſt, is worſe then he: No Fox to <hi>Herod,</hi> no Goat to the Wanton; no Tyger to the Murderer; no Wolfe to the Oppreſſor; no Horſe-leech to the Covetous; for Beaſts follow that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

It may be my ſacriledge, may the Church-robber, It may be my luxury, may the wanton, It may be my bold irreverence in the Houſe of God; may the prophane man ſay: whatſoever ſin it is, it may be mine, which hath wrought this deſolation on the earth; and then what an <hi>Achan,</hi> what a <hi>Jonah,</hi> what a Murderer am I?

Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> makes the puniſhment not onely infinite in duration, but in degrees, and increaſe, and was of opinion, that the paines of the damned are every moment intended, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, according, as even one ſin may ſpread it ſelf from man to man, from one generation to another, even to the worlds end, by its venemous contagion and enſample.

And therefore in our <hi>turn,</hi> this muſt go along with us, and continue the motion; the conſideration of the great hazard we run, when we <hi>turn from our evil wayes,</hi> and then turn back again.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, as a pardon doth nullifie former ſinnes, ſo it maketh our ſins, which we commit afterwards more grievous, and fatal; and as it is obſerved; that it is the part of a wiſe friend <hi>etiam leves ſuſpiciones fugere,</hi> to ſhun the leaſt ſuſpicion of offence, <note place="margin">Hier. ad pau. mach. &amp; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel.</note>

We are bound now, not only in a bond of common duty, but of gratitude: for his free favour is <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mella,</hi> as a clog, or yoke, to chain and fetter, and reſtrain us from ſin, that we commit not that every day, for which we muſt beg pardon every day.</p>
                     <p>A reaſon of this we may draw from the very love of God: for the anger of God, in a manner, is the effect, and product of his
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59296:150"/> love: He is Angry if we ſin; becauſe he loved us: he is diſpleaſed when we yeeld to Temptations; becauſe he loved us, and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is the hotter, becauſe his love was exceſſive. As the Husband which moſt affectionately loves the Wife of his youth, and would have her be as the <hi>loving Hinde, and pleaſant Roe,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Prov. <hi>5.19.</hi>
                        </note> but to himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, will not allow ſo much love from her, as may be conveighed in a look, or the glance of an eye; is jealous of her very looks, of her deportment, of her garments, and will have her to behave her ſelf with that Modeſty and ſtrangeneſs, <hi>ut quiſquis videat, metuat ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedere,</hi> that no man may be ſo bold, as to come ſo neer, as to ask the queſtion, or make mention of love; and all, becauſe he moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately loves her: So much, nay, farr greater is the love of God to our ſoules, which he hath married unto himſelf, in whom he deſires to dwell, and take delight, and ſo dearly he loves them, that he will not divide with the World and the Fleſh; but is ſtraight in Paſſion, if we caſt but a favourable <hi>ook,</hi> or look friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon that ſin, by which we firſt offended him; if we come but neer to that which hath the ſhew of a Rival, or Adverſary: but if we let our Deſires looſe, and fall from him, and Embrace the next Temptation, which wooes us, then he counts us guilty of ſpirituall <hi>whoredome,</hi> and Adultery; <hi>His jealouſie is cruel as the Grave,</hi> and this <hi>Jealouſie,</hi> which is an effect of his love, ſhall ſmoake againſt us. Firſt, it was <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Jealouſie,</hi> leſt we might tender cur ſervice to ſtrange gods, caſt our Affections upon falſe Riches, and deceitfull pleaſures; and now we have left Life for Death, preferred that which firſt wounded us, before him that cured us; it is Anger and Indignation, that he ſhould loſe us, whom he ſo loved; that wee ſhould fling him off, who ſo loved us; That he ſhould create, and then loſe us, and afterwards purchaſe, and redeeme us, and make us his againe, and we ſhould have no underſtanding, but run back againe from him into Captivity.</p>
                     <p>For in the Second place; as our ſinnes are greater after recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement, ſo if they doe not cancell the former Pardon, (as ſome are unwilling to grant) yet they call thoſe ſinnes to remembrance, which God caſt behind his back. For as good Works are deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſinne, and revive againe by Repentance, ſo do our evils, which are covered by Repentance, revive againe by ſinne. Not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my Almes are devoured by oppreſſion, my Chaſtity defloured by my uncleanneſs; my Faſting loſt in my luxurie; but my former ſinnes, which were ſcattered as miſt before the Sun, return again, and are a thick cloud between me, and the bright and ſhining mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God. Not that there is any mutability in God; no: God doth not repent of his gifts, but we may of our Repentance, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pardon, ſinne again, and ſo bring a new guilt upon our ſoules; and not onely that, but vengeance upon our Heads, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59296:150"/> tempt of his Mercy, and ſlighting of his former pardon. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can provoke God to Anger more, then the abuſe of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Mercy, nor doth his wrath burn more violently, then when 'tis firſt quencht, and allaid with the Teares of a ſinner, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards kindled againe by his ſinne. Then he that was well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be reconciled, will queſtion and condemne us, and yet make good his Promiſe; he that forgat our ſinnes, will Impute our ſinnes; and yet be Truth it ſelf. For remiſſion of ſinnes is a continued Act, and is, and remains, whiſt the condition which is required, remains, but when we faile in that, the door of Mercy, which before was wide open unto us, is ſhut againſt us; for ſhould he Juſtify, and forgive him, who breaks his Obligation, and returns to the ſame place, where he ſtood out againſt God, and fought againſt him? ſhall he be reconciled to him, who will be againe his Enemy? if the <hi>righteous relapſe,</hi> his righteouſneſs <hi>ſhall not be mention'd,</hi>

And why ſhould it be put to the Queſtion, whether God revoke his firſt Pardon? <hi>Quid prodeſt eſſe, quod eſſe non prodeſt?</hi> as <hi>Tertull.</hi> ſpeakes; if we think he did it not, or cannot doe it; yet what profit is it, that, that ſhould remain, which doth not profit? nay, which doth aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate our ſin? or what Pardon is that, which may remaine firme, when he to whom it was given, for his revolt, may be <hi>Turned</hi> into Hell? when the Servant falls down, he is <hi>moved with Compaſsion,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Matth. <hi>18.</hi>
                        </note> and looſeth him, and <hi>forgives him the debt;</hi> But when he takes his fellow ſervant by the Throat, he delivers him to the Tormenters, till he ſhould pay the utmoſt farthing; becauſe God is ever like unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, conſtant to his Rule; and he forgives, and puniſheth for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe he is ſo, and cannot change. For as we begg our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don upon promiſe, ſo doth he grant it upon ſuppoſition of perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; for he doth not pardon us our ſinne, that we ſhould ſinne again; and if we break our Promiſe, we cut ſelves have made a Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Pardon, or made it of as little Virtue and Power, as if it had never been. For as the Schools tell us, that the Sacraments are <hi>Proteſtationes fidei,</hi> the Proteſtations of our Faith; ſo is our Prayer for Pardon, a Proteſtation and promiſe of Repentance, which is nothing elſe, but a continued obedience: we pray to God, <hi>To caſt our Sinnes behinde his back,</hi> with this Reſolution, to extirpate them; and upon this Condition, God ſeales our Pardon, which we muſt make a motive, not to ſinne and fall back, but to a new life, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59296:151"/> Conſtant obedience; If we <hi>Turne,</hi> and <hi>Turne</hi> back againe, he may Turne his face from us for Ever.</p>
                     <p>Againe, in the <hi>Third Place;</hi> we have reaſon to arme our ſelves againſt Temptation, after Pardon; becauſe by our relapſe, we doe not onely add ſin to ſin, but we are made more inclinable to it, and anon more familiar with it, and ſo more averſe and backward to the Acts of Piety: <note place="margin">Tert. l. <hi>1.</hi> ad uxorem. c. <hi>8.</hi>

                     </gap>, ſaith <hi>Baſil,</hi> as it brings us to Conſultation, ſo is it a faire Introduction to Piety it ſelf. Feare takes us by the hand, and is a Schoolmaſter unto us, and when Feare hath well diſciplin'd and Catechiſed us, then love takes us in hand, and perfects our Converſion, ſo that we may ſeem to goe from Feare to Love, as from a School to an Univerſitie. In the 28. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> at the Twelfth verſe, <hi>Jacob</hi> ſees a Ladder <hi>ſet upon</hi> the Earth, and the <hi>Top of it reaching up to heaven,</hi> and we may obſerve, that <hi>Jacob</hi> makes Feare the firſt ſtep of the ladder, for when he awakes, as in an extaſie he cryes out, <hi>Quam terribilis iſte locus?</hi> how dreadfull is this place? verſe 17. ſo that feare is as it were the firſt rung and ſtep of the Ladder, and God on the top, and Angels Aſcending and Deſcending; Love, and Zeal, and many Graces between. Think what we pleaſe, diſgrace it if we will, and faſten to it the badge of ſlavery and ſervility, it is a bleſſed thing thus to feare, the firſt ſtep to happineſs, and one ſtep helps us up to another, and ſo by degrees we are brought <hi>ad culme Sionis,</hi> to the top of the Ladder, to the Top of perfection, to God Himſelf, whoſe Majeſty firſt wounds us with feare, and then gently bindes us up, and makes us to love him; who leads us through this darkneſs, through this dread and terror, into ſo great light, makes us Tremble firſt, that we may at laſt be as mount Sion, and ſtand faſt, and firme for ever.</p>
                  <p>We now paſſe, and riſe one ſtep higher, to take a view of this feare of puniſhment, not onely as uſefull, but lawfull, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not under the Law alone, but under the Goſpel, as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to <hi>Turne</hi> us from ſinne, and as a motive to ſtrengthen and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold us in the wayes of Righteouſneſſe, not onely as a reſtraint from ſionne; but as a preſervative of Holineſs, and as a help and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance unto us in our progreſſe in the wayes of perfection.</p>

                  <p>For againe, we muſt not imagine, That all things that are done in the world, are the worke of his hand, or the effect of that Power
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59296:170"/> by which he brings mighty things to paſſe, nor can we ſo much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get God and his Goodneſs, as to imagine, that upon every Action of man, he hath ſet a <hi>Dixit, &amp; factum eſt,</hi> he <hi>ſpake the word,</hi> and <hi>it was done,</hi> he commanded, and it became Neceſſary; for ſome Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there be, which God doth neither abſolutely will, nor power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reſiſt, but in his Wiſedome permitteth to be done, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe could not be done, but by his permiſſion; nor doth this will of permiſſion fall croſſe with any other will of his; not with his <hi>abſolute</hi> will, for he abſolutely permitteth them; not with his primary and Naturall will; for though by his Naturall will, he would bring men to happineſſe, though he forbid ſinne, though he deteſt it, as that which is moſt contrary to his very nature, and which makes men Divels and Enemies to him; yet he may Juſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it; and the reaſon is plaine. For man is not as God, <hi>qui ſibi ſufficit ad beatitudinem,</hi> who is all-ſufficient and Happineſſe it ſelf, and therefore was placed in an Eſtate, where he might work out his owne Happineſſe, but ſtill with a Poſſibility of being miſerable. And herein was the Goodneſſe and Wiſedome of God made vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; and as from his goodneſſe it is, that he loved his Creature, ſo in his goodneſſe and Wiſedome he placed before him <hi>Good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,</hi> that he might lay hold on Happineſſe, and be good willingly, and not of Neceſsity. For it is Impoſsible for any Finite Creature who hath not his completenes, his perfection in himſelf, to purchaſe heaven, but upon ſuch termes, as that he might have loſt it, nor to loſe it, but upon ſuch Termes, as that he might have took it by violence. For every Law, as it ſuppoſeth a poſsibility of being kept, ſo doth it alſo a poſsibility of being broken, which cannot be without permiſsion of ſinne, <hi>Lex juſto non eſt poſita,</hi> if Goodneſſe had been as Eſſentiall to man, as his Nature and ſoule by which he is; if God had interceded by his Omnipotency, and by an irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble force, kept ſinne from entring into the world; The Jewes had not heard the noiſe of the Trumpet under the Law, nor the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples the Sermon on the Mount under the Goſpel; there had been no uſe of the Comfortable breath of his Promiſes, nor the Terror of his Threatnings; for who would make a Law againſt that, which he knows will never come to paſſe? a Law againſt ſinne, ſuppoſeth a permiſsion to ſinne, and a poſsibility of ſinning. Laſtly, it ſtands in no ſhew of oppoſition to his occaſion'd and conſequent will; for we muſt ſuppoſe ſinne, before we can take up the leaſt conceit of of any will in God to puniſh. <hi>Omnis poena, ſi juſta eſt, peccati poena eſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in his Retractations; all puniſhment that is juſt, is the puniſhment of ſinne, and therefore God, who of his Naturall Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe would not have man commit ſinne, out of his Juſtice wills man's Deſtruction, and will not repent: <hi>Sic totus Deus bonus eſt, dum pro bono omnia eſt,</hi>

But it is one thing to Propheſy a Thing ſhall be done, and another to doe it; <hi>Hector</hi> in <hi>Homer</hi> foretells <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles</hi> Death, and <hi>Herod</hi> the fall of <hi>Mezentius</hi> in <hi>Virgil,</hi> and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour the Deſtruction of <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> but neither was <hi>Hectors</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy the cauſe of <hi>Achilles</hi> Death, nor <hi>Herods</hi> of <hi>Mezentius,</hi> nor our Saviour of the Deſtruction of <hi>Hieruſalem; vade &amp; dic, Goe, and tell them;</hi> makes it a plame prediction, what manner of men they would be, to whom Chriſt was to ſpeake, ſtubborn and refractory, and ſuch as would harden their faces againſt the Truth.

And here, if their eyes were ſhut, it were fit one would Think, they ſhould be open'd; True (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>) if they had been borne blinde, or if this had been the immediate Act of God; but becauſe they wilfully ſhut their eyes, he doth not ſay ſimply,

                  <p>But if we will tie our ſelves to the letter, we may finde theſe ſeveral expreſſions in ſeveral Texts, 1. <hi>Pharaoh hardned his heart;</hi> 2. <hi>Pharaohs heart was hardned;</hi> 3. <hi>God hardned Pharaohs heart;</hi> and now let us Judge whether it be ſafer to interpret <hi>Gods induration</hi> by <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> or <hi>Pharaohs</hi> by <hi>Gods;</hi> for if God did actually and immediately harden <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, then <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was a meer patient, nor was it in his power to let the people go, and ſo God ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> to bid him do that, which he could not, and which he could not, becauſe God had hardned him; but if <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally harden his own heart (as 'tis plain enough he did) then Gods Induration can be no more then a juſt permiſſion, and ſuffering him to be hardned, which in his wiſdom and the courſe he ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily takes, he would not, and therefore could not hinder; <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficit unus Huic operi,</hi> one is enough for this work of induration, and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59296:172"/> we need not take in God; for to keep to the letter in the former hakes a main principle of truth; that God is in no degree Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſin; but to keep to the letter in the latter cleeres all doubts, prevents all objections, and opens a wide and effectual door to let as in to a cleer ſight of the meaning of the former; For that man doth harden his owne heart, is undeniably true; But that God doth harden the heart is denied by moſt, is ſpoken darkly and doubtfully by ſome, nor is it poſſible that any Chriſtian ſhould ſpeak it plainly or preſent it in this hideous &amp; monſtrous ſhape, but muſt be forced to ſtick and dreſſe it up with ſome far fetcht, and impertinent limitation, or diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>For laſtly, I cannot ſee, how God can poſitively be ſaid to do that, which is done already to his hand; For induration is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and natural effect of ſin; and to bring in God alone is to leave nothing for the devil or man to do, but to make Satan of a Serpent, a very flie indeed, and the ſoul of man nothing elſe but a forge and ſhop to work thoſe ſins in, which may burn and conſume it ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly.

This indeed, ſome have made their <hi>Helena,</hi> but 'tis an ugly and ill-favoured one; for this they fight unto Death, even for the Book of life, till they have blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out their names with the Blood of their Brethren: This is Dreſt out unto them as ſavoury meat ſet for their palate, who had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be carried up to heaven in <hi>Elias</hi> fiery Charriot, then to pace it thither with Trouble and paine. That GOD hath abſolutely Decreed the ſalvation of ſome particular men, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſentence of Death upon others, is as Muſick to ſome eares, like <hi>Davids</hi> Harpe, to refreſh them, and drive away the Evill Spirit. <hi>Et qui amant, ſibi ſomnia fingunt,</hi> mens deſires doe eaſily raiſe a belief, and when they are told of ſuch a Decree, they dreame themſelves to Heaven; for, if we obſerve it, they ſtill chuſe the better part, and place themſelves with the ſheep at the right Hand, and when the Controverly of the Inheritance of Heaven is on foot, to whom it belongs, they do as the <hi>Romanes</hi> did, who, when two Cities conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding about a piece of Ground, made them their Judge to determine whoſe it was, fairly gave ſentence on their own behalf, and took it to themſelves: becauſe they read of <hi>Election,</hi> elect themſelves, which is more indeed, then any man can deny, and more I am ſure, then themſelves can prove; And now, <hi>Oh Death, where is thy ſting?</hi> The ſting of Death is ſin, but it cannot reach them, and the ſtrength of ſinne is the Law, but it cannot bind them; for ſinne it ſelf ſhall Turne to the good of theſe Elect and Choſen Veſſels; and we have ſome reaſon to ſuſpect, that in the ſtrength of this Doctrine, and a groundleſs conceit that they are theſe particular men, they walk on all the daies of their life in fraud, and malice, in Hypocriſy and diſobedience, in all that uncleannes and pollution of ſinne, which is enough to wipe out any name out of the Book of Life; <hi>Hoc ſaxum defendit Manlius,</hi>

                  <p>For Concluſion; we read of the Philoſopher <hi>Thales,</hi> that lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his eyes to obſerve the Courſe of the Starres, he fell into the water, which gave the occaſion to a Damſell called <hi>Threſſa,</hi> of an ingenious and bitter ſcoffe: That he who was ſo buſy to ſee what was done in Heaven, could not obſerve what was even before his feet; and it is as true of them, who are ſo bold and forward in the Contemplation of Gods Eternall Decree, many times they fall dangerouſly into thoſe Errours which ſwallow them up; they are too bold with God, and ſo negligent of themſelves, Talke more what he does, or hath done, or may doe, then do what they ſhould; are ſo much in Heaven, and to ſo little purpoſe, that they loſe it; But the Apoſtles method is ſure, to <hi>uſe diligence to make our Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſure,</hi> and ſo read the Decree in our Obedience, and ſyncere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and if we can perſwade our ſelves, that our Names are written in the Book of Life, yet ſo to behave our ſelves, ſo to work on with Feare and Trembling, as if it were yet to be done; as it was told the Philoſopher, that he might have ſeen the figure of the Starres in the water, but could not ſee the water in the ſtarres. All the knowledge we can gaine of the Decree, is from our ſelves; it is written in heaven, and the Characters we read it by on Earth: are <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance:</hi> if we beleeve, and repent, then God ſpeaks to us from heaven, and tells us, we ſhall not die; If we be dead to ſinne, and alive to Righteouſneſſe, we are enrolled, and our names are written <hi>in the book of Life;</hi> here, here alone is the Decree le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, and if our eye faile not in the one, it cannot be deceived in the other; If we love Chriſt, and keep his Commandements, we are in the number of Elect, and were choſen from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p>Be not then caſt downe, and dejected in thy ſelf with what God hath done, or may do by his abſolute Power, for thou maiſt build upon it; He never ſaved an Impenitent, nor will ever caſt away a Repentant ſinner.

When we take our journey, a Sermon is our farewell, and when we returne, it is our welcome home. If we Feaſt, a Sermon is the Grace before it, if we ſayle, a Sermon muſt weigh Anchor; and if we fight, a Sermon is the Alarum to Battell; If we rejoyce, we call to the Preacher to Pipe to us, that we may dance (for many times we chuſe our Preachers, as we do our Muſicians by the Eare and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, not by judgement; and it muſt needs be a rare choice, which a Woman &amp; ignorance makes) and ſuch an one is to us <hi>as a lovely ſong of one that hath a very pleaſant voice, Ezek.</hi> 33.1. and if we be in Grief, he muſt turn the key and change his note, and mourne to us, that we may lament. A Sermon is the grand Sallet, to uſher in every diſh; like <hi>Soſia</hi> or <hi>Davus</hi> in the Comedy, ſcarce any Scene, or part of our life without it: It is <hi>Prologus Galeatus,</hi> a Prologue that will fitt either Comedy or Tragedy, every purpoſe, every Action, every buſineſs of our Life. In a word; what had they, which we have not in meaſure preſſed downe? They had the Favour, and Countenance of God, They had the bleſſings of the Basket, ſo had we, if we could have pinn'd it, and kept them in, and not plaid the wantons in this light, and ſo let them fly away from us, that we can but look after them, and ſadly ſay, <hi>we had them;</hi> They had Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bleſſings, we have Graces and ſpirituall endowments, more light, and richer Promiſes; more and more Gracious Privileges then they; Their Adminiſtration <hi>was with Glory, but burs is more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</hi> Glorious things are ſpoken of this City, glorious things are ſeen amongſt us, able to deceive a Prophet, nay, if it were poſsible, the very Elect: For he that ſhal ſee our outward formality, the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, the demureneſs, the talkativeneſs of our looks and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, when we flock and preſs to Sermons; he that ſhall hear our

Be not deceived, benefits and burdens (thou haſt laden me daily with thy benefits, ſaith David) and burdens which, if we bare not well, and as we ſhould do, will grinde us to pieces: All prerogatives are with conditions, &amp; if the condition be not kept, they turn to ſcorpions, they either heal or kill us, they either lift us up to Bliſſe, or throw us down to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: there is Heaven in a priviledge, and there is Hell in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59296:183"/> fail, <hi>his mercy endureth for ever;</hi> but to think of our weakneſſe, and then to fall, and becauſe we came infirm, and diſeaſed into the world, to kill our ſelves; to ſeek out death in the errour of our life, to dally and play with danger; to be willing to joyn with the temptation at the firſt ſhew and approach, as if we were made for no other end, and then to complain of weakneſſe, is to charge God and nature fooliſhly, and not onely to impute our ſins to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> but to God himſelf; and thus we bankrupt our ſelves, and complain we were born poor, we criple our ſelves, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain we are lame, we deliver up our ſelves, and fal willingly under the temptation, and then pretend it was a ſon of <hi>Anack,</hi> too ſtrong for ſuch Graſhoppers as we, we delight in ſin, we trade in ſin, we were brought up in it, and we continue in it, and make it our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, our friend, with which we moſt familiarly converſe, and then comfort our ſelves, and caſt all the fault on our temper and conſtitution, and the corruption of our nature, and we attribute our full growth in ſin, to that ſeed of ſin which we ſhould have choked, which had never ſhot up into the blade, and born ſuch evil fruit, but that we manured and watered it, and were more then willing, that it ſhould grow and multiply. And this though it be a great ſin, as being the mother of all thoſe miſhapen births, thoſe Monſters, which walk about the world, we dreſſe and deck up, and give it a fair and glorious name, and call it <hi>Humility,</hi> which is, ſaith <hi>Hilary,</hi> the hardeſt and greateſt work of our faith, to which it is ſo unlike, that it is the greateſt enemy it hath, and every day weakens, and diſenables it, that it doth not <hi>work by charity,</hi> but leaves us Captives to the world, and ſin, which but for this conceit, it would eaſily vanquiſh, and tread down under our feet. We may call it <hi>Humility,</hi> but it is <hi>Pride;</hi> a ſtubborn, <note place="margin">Humilitas ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximum Fidei o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Hil. in Ps. <hi>130.</hi>

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59296:184"/> look upon the enemy; <hi>nec mirum, ſi vincantur, qui jam victi ſunt,</hi> and it is no marvail, they ſhould fall, and periſh, whom their own ſo low and groundleſſe opinion hath already over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, though I deny not a derived weakneſſe, and from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> though I leave it not after Baptiſme as ſubſiſtent by it ſelf, or bound to the Center of the earth with the <hi>Manichee,</hi> nor waſht to nothing in the Font with others, yet 'tis eaſie to deceive our ſelves, and to think it more contagious then it is, more operative, more deſtructive then it would be, if we would ſhake off this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and rowſe our ſelves, and ſtand up againſt it, <hi>&amp; ignavia no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtr fortis eſt,</hi> and it may be, it is our ſloth, and Cowardize, that makes it ſtrong; for certainly, there muſt be more force then this hath, to make us ſo wicked as many times we are, and there be more promoters of the kingdom of Darkneſſe in us, then that which we brought with us into the world. Lord, what a noiſe hath Original ſin made amongſt the ſons of <hi>Adam?</hi> and what ill uſe hath been made of it? When this Lion roares, all the Beaſts of the Forreſt tremble, and yet are beaſts ſtill; we hear of it, and are aſtoniſht, and become worſe and worſe, and yet there are but few, that exactly know what it is: when we are Infants, we do not know that we are ſo, no more then the Tree doth, that it grows, much leſſe can we diſcover what poyſon we brought with us into the world, which, as it is the nature of ſome kinde of poyſon, though it have no viſible operation for the preſent, may ſome years after break forth from the head to the foot, in ſwellings, and ſores full of corruption, and not be fully pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out to our lives end. Again, in the opening and dawning of our reaſon, we have ſcarſe ſo much light, as to ſee our ſelves by, and we underſtand little more then the rod, which we ſoon forget, and boldly venture upon the ſame fault, for which we felt it, and ſhould count it a virtue and our bounden duty to do it, but for the ſmart it brings with it, which yet can work in us little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of guilt. And then in our riper age, our blood runs in our veines with more heat, and we are active, and ſtrong to act over them with ſome ſenſe and feeling, which we learnt but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly in our nonage, which our Nurſe pratled into us, which ſervants read to us with a licentious tongue, and wanton behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; and many times we repeat and expreſſe thoſe rudiments and principles of thrift, which thoſe who are ſet over us do commonly firſt teach, and we ſhew our ſelves as perfect in them, as thoſe old Gray-headed Atheiſts, that taught them. Theſe we take up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; Wantonneſſe, Revenge, love of the world, and being uſed unto them, they are no burdens, and if at any time they wring us, we have learnt ſo much at Church, as to caſt them off upon <hi>Adam,</hi> to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59296:184"/> eaſe our ſelves with the remembrance of our natural weakneſs, though we know not what it is, nor have learnt it half ſo perfectly, as we have done thoſe other leſſons, which have no evil in them, as we think, but that which is of ancient extraction, derived from the firſt evil, that was ever ſeen under the Sun. But then in our old age, which is a complication, and collection of all ſins, as well as diſeaſes, how ſhould a dim eye diſcover it in the midſt of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny evil habits wreathed and platted one within another, covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe wrought in with luxury, and with luxury, cruelty, each thwarting, and yet friendly complying the one with the other? can we now ſay that theſe ſins were thus multiplied, and raiſed to ſuch a height by the power and continued force of that fatal Legacie, which our firſt Parents left us? or was this the beſt crown wherewith our mothers crowned us in the day of our concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? can we labour and toyl? can we affect and ſtudy ſin? can we make it our buſineſſe? our ambition to walk in our evil wayes, and ſay, that we were put in them from the beginning, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced forward by the violent hand, that firſt put us in? Indeed, the old man, the old ſinner is glad to heare of another <hi>Old man,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he never intend to Crucifie him, nor well underſtands what it is: no more then the vulgar do Anti-chriſt, which in their fancy is a Beaſt, and hath horns; <hi>The multitude of years</hi> (though Age be talkative,) yet many times know no more of this primitive, and ſo much famed evil, then they <hi>who were but of yeſterday.</hi> For even they who have been brought up in <hi>Nob,</hi> in the City and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Prieſts, have not all agreed in their diſcovery of this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but have preſented it in ſo many ſhapes, that it will be hard to chuſe, and ſay this is the right, this, this it is: I am ſure their opinions and more, then the ſins can be, which Original ſin doth neceſſarily bring into act. The <hi>Ana-Baptiſts</hi> in the dayes of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers called it <hi>Somnium Auguſtini,</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtins</hi> dream; <note place="margin">See Melanct. l. c. de perc.</note> ſome make it a ſin, and ſome a puniſhment onely, ſome make it both; ſome have made it to be nothing but the want and deprivation of Original righteouſneſſe, or an habitual averſion, and obliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the will; others have made it the image of the devil; There be, that conceived the whole eſſence of man to be corrupted; there be that make it an Accident, and there have been that have made it a ſubſtance, and there have not been wanting thoſe, who have made it nothing; All agree in this; that there is ſomething in us which we muſt ſtrive to ſubdue, and keep under, ſome call it our natural inclination, which may be the matter of vertue as well as of vice; others Original ſin, which to yeeld to, is to die, but to curb, and reſtrain, to fight againſt and to conquer, is the great work and Buſines of a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeake not this to take away our Originall weakneſſe, but to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59296:185"/> take it away from Being an excuſe; For in the Second place, our Naturall weakneſs is ſo farre from excuſing our ſinne, or making it leſs voluntary, That we are bound by our very profeſsion, to Crucify this Old <hi>Adam</hi> in us, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify our Earthly Members and luſts, <hi>non exerere quod Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti ſumus,</hi> not to be, what indeed we are, to be in the Body, but out of the Body, to Tame the wantonneſs of the <hi>Fleſh:</hi> for did we not for this give up our names unto Chriſt? were we not Baptized in this Faith? It is my Melancholy, ſaith the Envious, It is my Choler; ſaith the Revenger; It is my Blood, ſaith the wanton; it is my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, ſaith the Glutton; and ſo every man runnes on in his own wayes, becauſe the winde that drives him, comes from no other Treaſury, but himſelf, no other corner, but his corrupt heart; <hi>fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu peccatorum utuntur, ipſa ſubducunt,</hi> they are content to reape the fruit and pleaſure of ſinne, but withdraw the ſin it ſelf, and remove it out of the way: But this is not the right uſe of our natural weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which may be left in us, but (as all agree) to Humble, not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arme us, to ſhew we are men, weak and impotent in our ſelves, not to make us proud and Rebellious againſt our God, but to ſet us upon our Guard, and make us beſtirre our ſelves, and call up all our Forces, and ſend our Prayers, as Embaſſadours to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for help and ſuccour, againſt this Inmate, and Domeſtick E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.

                  <p>A dangerous errour it is; and, we have reaſon to fear, hath ſunk many a ſoul to that ſupine careleſſnes, to that deadneſſe, from whence they could never riſe again; for this is one of the wiles of our enemy, not onely to make uſe of the flying and fading va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of this world; but of the beſt Graces of God, to file and hath hammer them, and make them ſnares; and hath wrought temptations out of that, which ſhould ſtrengthen us againſt them: Faith is ſuborn'd to keep out Charity; the ſpirit of truth is named to lead us into errour, and the power of Gods Grace hath loſt its authority and Energie in our unſavorie and fruitleſſe Panegyricks: we hear the ſound and name of it, we bleſſe and applaud it, but the power of it is loſt, not viſible in any motion in any Action, in any progreſſe we make in thoſe wayes in which along grace will aſſiſt us; floats on the Tongue, but never moves either heart, or hand.

This is a great evil under the Sun, and one principal cauſe of all that evil that is upon the earth; and makes us ſtand ſtill, and look on, and delight in it, and leave it to God alone, and his power to remove it, as if it concern'd us not at all, and it were too daring an attempt for us mortals, <hi>the ſons of Adam,</hi> to purge and clenſe that <hi>Augaean</hi> ſtable, which we our ſelves have filled with dung; as if Gods wiſdom and Juſtice did not move at all, and his mercy and power were alone buſie in the work of our ſalvation; buſie to ſave the adulterer; for though he be the member of an <hi>Harlot,</hi> yet when God will, he ſhall be made a <hi>member of Chriſt;</hi> to ſave the ſeditious: For though he now breath nothing but Hail-ſtones and coals of fire; yet a time will come, where he ſhall be made peaceable, whether he will or no; to ſave them who reſolve to go on in their ſin, for he can check them when he pleaſe, and bring them back to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and holineſſe; in a word, to ſave them, whoſe Damnation ſleepeth not. I may ſay with the Father, <hi>utinam mentirer,</hi> would to God in this I were a lier; but we have too much probability
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:59296:188"/> to induce us to beleeve it, as a truth; that they who are ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to publiſh the free and irreſiſtible power of Gods Grace, and call it his Honour; diſhonour him more by the Neglect of their duty, which is quite loſt, and forgot in an unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acknowledgement of what God can, and a lazy expectation of what he will work in them, and ſo make God Omnipotent, to do what his Wiſdom ſorbids, and themſelves weak and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to do, what by the ſame wiſdom he commands: and then (when they commune with their heart, and finde not there thoſe longings and pantings after piety, that true deſire and endeavour to mortifie their earthly members, which God requires, when in this Dialogue, between one, and himſelf, their hearts cannot tell them they have watched one houre with Chriſt) flatter and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort themſelves, that this emptineſſe, and nakedneſſe, ſhall never be imputed to them by God, who if he had pleaſed, might have wrought all in them in a moment, by that force, which fleſh and blood could never withſtand; And thus they ſin, and pray, and pray and ſin, and their impiety and devotion like the Sun and the Moon have their interchangeable courſes, it is now night with them, and anon 'tis day; and then night again, and it is not eaſie to diſcern which is their day, or which is their night, for there is darkneſſe over them both; They hear and commend vertue and piety, and ſince they cannot but think, that vertue is more then a breath, and that it is not enough to commend it, they pray, and are frequent in it, pray continually, but do nothing; pray, but do not watch, pray, but not ſtrive againſt a temptation, but leave that to a mightier hand to do for them, and without them, whilſt they pray and ſin; call upon God for help, when they fight againſt him; as if it were Gods will to have it ſo; for if he would have had it otherwiſe, he would have heard their prayers, and wrought it in them; and therefore will be content with his Talent though hid in a napkin, which, if he had pleaſed, might have been made ten, and with his ſeed again, which if he had ſpoke the word, had brought forth fruit a hundred fold. Hence it comes to paſſe, that though they be very evil, yet they are very ſecure, this being the triumph over their Faith, not to conquer the world, but to leave that work for the Lord of Hoſts Himſelf, and in all humility to ſtay till he do it; for they can do nothing of themſelves, and they have done what they can, which is nothing, and now they are heartleſſe, feeble, and (if I may ſo ſpeak) this do-nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, which may be as hot on the tongue of a Phariſee, and tied to his Phylactery, muſt be made a ſigne of their election before all times, who in time do thoſe things, of which we have been told often, that they that do them ſhall not inherit the kingdome of Heaven.</p>

                  <p>I do not derogate from the power of Gods grace (they that do, are not worthy to feel it, but ſhall feel that power, which ſhall cruſh them to pieces) they rather derogate from its power, who bring it in to raiſe that obedience, which comming with that tempeſt and violence, it muſt needs deſtroy, and take away quite; for what obedience is there, where nothing is done? where he that is under command doth nothing? <hi>vis ergo iſta, non gratia,</hi> ſaith <hi>Arnobius,</hi> this were not grace, or royal favour, but a ſtrange kinde of emulation to gain the upper hand.

                  <p>But it may be ſaid, that when we are fallen from God we are not able to riſe again of our ſelves; we willingly grant it; that we have therefore need of new ſtrength, and new power to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us, which may raiſe us up, we denie it not; and then Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that not onely the power, but the very act of our recovery is from God, ingratitude it ſelf cannot denie it; and then, that man can no more withſtand the power of that grace, which God is ready to ſupply us with, then an infant can his birth, or the dead their Reſurrection; that we are turned whether we will or no, is a concluſion, which theſe premiſes will not yeeld. This flint will yeeld no ſuch fire, though you ſtrike never ſo oft; we are, indeed, ſometimes ſaid to ſleep, and ſometimes to be <hi>Dead in ſin;</hi> but it is ill building concluſions upon no better Baſis then a figure, or becauſe we are ſaid to be dead in ſin, infer a neceſſity of riſing when we are called; nor is our obedience to Gods inward call of the ſame nature, with the obedience of the Creature to the voice and command of the Creator (for the Creature hath neither rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon nor will as man hath) nor doth his power work after the ſame manner in the one as in the other. How many <hi>Fiats</hi> of God have been fruſtrate in this kinde? how often he hath he ſmote our ſtony, and rocky hearts, and no water flowed out? how often hath he ſaid <hi>Fiat lux</hi> let there be light, when we remained in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? for we are free agents, and he made us ſo, when he made us men, and our actions when his power is mighty in us, are not neceſſary but voluntary; not doth his power work according to the working of our Fancy, nor lies within the level of our carnal

                  <p>We think that God can do whatſoever he can; but we muſt know, that as he is powerful, and can do all things, ſo he is wiſe, and ſweetly diſpoſeth all things, as he will, and he will not ſave us againſt our will, for to neceſſitate us to goodneſſe, were not to try our obedience, but to force it, <hi>&amp; quod neceſsitas praeſtat, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretiat ipſa.</hi> Neceſſity takes of the price and value of that it works, and makes it of no worth at all; And then God doth not volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily take his grace from any, but if the power of it defend us not from ſin and death, it is becauſe we abuſe and neglect it, and will not work with it, which is ready to work with us; For Grace is not blinde, as Fortune, <hi>nec cultores praeterit, nec haeret contemptoribus,</hi> ſhe will neither paſſe by them, who will receive her, nor dwell with thoſe perſons which contemn her, nor ſave thoſe who will deſtroy themſelves.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this; He is moſt unworthy to receive Grace, who in the leaſt degree detracts from the power of it; and he is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy who magnifies, and rejects it, and makes his liſe an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt his Doctrine, ſayes he cannot be reſiſted, and reſiſts it every day; he that denies the power of it, is a ſcarſe a Chriſtian, and he is the worſt of Chriſtians who will not gird up his loins, and work out his ſalvation, but loiters and ſtands idle all the day long, ſhadows and pleaſeth himſelf under the expectation of what he will do, and ſo Turns it into wantonneſſe. Let us not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe the Grace of God, and then we cannot magnifie it enough; but he that will not ſet his hand to work, upon a fancy, that he wants Grace; he that will not hearken after Grace though ſhe knock and knock again, (as Fortune was ſaid to have done at <hi>Galbas</hi> gate) till ſhe be weary, hath already deſpiſed the Grace of God, and cannot plead the want of that for any excuſe, which he might have had, but put it off, nay, which he had, but ſo uſed it, as if it had been no grace at all.

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:59296:191"/> great difficulty or impoſſibility of avoiding it may be his Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and ſpeak for him: but if he make room for it, when he might exclude it, if he Embrace that which may let it in, or make no uſe of the light that detects it; if he will, or reject not, or be indifferent, if he diſtaſt the truth for ſome croſſe aſpect it hath on his deſignes, and love a lie, becauſe it ſmiles upon them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes them, then this ignorance is a ſin, and the laſt the greateſt, and therefore cannot make up an excuſe for another ſin, for thoſe ſins which it brings in, in Triumph; but is ſo much the more Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, in that we had light, but did turn our face away and would not ſee it, or did hate and deſpiſe it, and blow it out: For he that will not know the wayes of life or calls his evil wayes by that name, may well be askt the queſtion, <hi>why he will die?</hi>

                     </note> But in the next place: when we finde ſome <hi>check of Conſcience,</hi> ſome regret, ſome gain-ſayings in our minde, that we are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to go on in theſe evil wayes, and yet take courage and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, we are ready to pleaſe our ſelves with this thought, and are ſoon of the Opinion, that what we are doing, or have done already, if it be evil, yet is done againſt our will; and if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction overtake us, it ſeiſes on them, that did ſo much hate and abhor it, that we ſhook and trembled, when it did but ſhew it ſelf to us in a thought. And this I take to be an errour as full of danger, as it is void of reaſon, of no uſe at all, but to make us fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour our ſelves, and ingage and adventure further in thoſe wayes which lead unto death.</p>
                  <p>I deny not, but as there is great difference in ſins, ſo there may be a difference alſo in committing them; that the righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doth not drink down ſin with that delight and greedineſſe which the wicked do, that they do not ſport themſelves in the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:59296:192"/> wayes of death, nor fall into them with that eaſineſſe, with that precipitancy, that they do not count it as a purchaſe to ſatisfie their luſts, and that moſt times the event is different; for the one fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down at the feet of God for mercy; the other hardens his heart, and face, and wil not bow: but yet, I cannot number it amongſt the marks and characters of a righteous man, or (as ſome love to ſpeak, and may ſo ſpeak, if they well underſtood what they ſaid) of one of the elect, when he falls into any mortal grievous ſin, as Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Murder, and the like, that he doth not fall <hi>plenâ voluntate,</hi> with a full conſent, and will but more faintly, and remiſsly, as it were with more Gravity, then other men; that he did actually fall, but was not willing to fal, that is, that he did wil indeed the ſin which he did commit, but yet did commit it againſt his will. Nor can I think our conſent is not full, when we chide and rebuke the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and yet ſuffer it to win ground, and gain more and more Advantage againſt us, when we have ſome grudgings, ſome petty murmurs in our ſelves; and in our heart defame thoſe ſins, which we ſhew openly in our Actions: for when we have done that which is evil, we cannot ſay, we would not have done it; when we have made roome for ſin to enter, we cannot ſay, that we would have excluded it.</p>
                  <p>For, 1. I cannot ſee how theſe two ſhould meet ſo friendly, a <hi>double Will,</hi> nay, a <hi>contrary will</hi> in reſpect of one, and the ſame Act, eſpecially when ſin is not in <hi>fieri</hi> but in <hi>facto eſſe,</hi> when the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation hath prevailed, and the will determined its act. Indeed, whilſt the Act was ſuſpended, and our minde wavering, and in doubt where to faſten, or which part to embrace, whether to take the wedge of Gold, or to withdraw; whether to ſmite my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or to ſheath up my ſword, and anger together; whether to taſte, or not to taſte the forbidden Fruit; when it was in labour as it were, and did ſtrive and ſtruggle between theſe two; the delightfulneſſe, and unlawfulneſſe of the Object, between the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, and the Law, whileſt the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, there may be ſuch an indifferency, a kinde of <hi>willing,</hi> and <hi>nilling,</hi> a profer, and diſtaſt, an approach and a pawſe, an inclination to the object, anda fear to come neer: But when the <hi>ſenſe</hi> hath prevailed with the will to determine for it againſt the reaſon, when luſt hath conceived, and brought forth, then there is no room for this indifferencie, becauſe the will hath determined its act, and concluded for the ſenſe againſt the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for the Fleſh againſt the ſpirit. For we muſt not miſtake the fluctuations and pawſes, and contentions of the minde, and look upon them, as the Acts of the will, which hath but one ſimple, and indiviſible act, which it cannot divide between two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſo as to look ſtedfaſtly on the one, and yet reflect alſo with a
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:59296:192"/> look of liking upon the other, our Saviour hath fitted us with an inſtance, <hi>you cannot ſerve God and Mammon:</hi> if we know then what the will is, we ſhall know alſo, that it is impoſſible to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it, and ſhall be aſhamed of that Apologie, to ſay, we ſin <hi>ſemiple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nâ voluntate,</hi> with an imperfect, with an half will, we know not how. There may be indeed a kind of velleity and inclination to that which is good, when the will hath embraced that which is evil; there may be a <hi>probo meliora,</hi> a liking of the better, when I have choſen the worſer part; which is not a willing, but an approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, an allowing, that which is juſt, which ariſeth from that light of our minde and Law of our underſtanding from that natural Judgement, by which we diſcern that which is evil, from that which is good, and is an Act of our reaſon, and not of our will; and thus I may will a thing, and yet diſlike it, I may embrace, and condemn it, I may commend Chaſtity, and be a wanton, Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality and be a <hi>Nabal,</hi> Clemency and be a <hi>Nero,</hi> Chriſtianity, and be worſe then a Jew; I may ſubſcribe to the Law, that it is juſt, and break it; I may take the <hi>cup of Fornication,</hi> and drink deep of it for ſome pleaſant taſte it hath, when I know it will be my poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>And therefore: in the ſecond place; this renitency, and reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of Conſcience is ſo far from Apologizing for us, as for ſuch as ſin not with a full conſent, that moſt times it doth adde weight to it, and much aggravate our ſin, and doth plainly demonſtrate a moſt violent, and eager conſent of the will, which would not be reſtrained, but paſſed as it were this Rampier, and Bulwark, which was raiſed againſt it, to the forbidden object; which neither the Law, nor the voice, and check of Conſcience (which to us in the place of God) could ſtop or reſtrain, and that we play the wantons and dally with ſin, as the wanton doth with his ſtrumpet, that we do <hi>opponere oſtium, non claudere,</hi> put the door gently to, <note place="margin">Senec. <hi>N</hi> Q. l. <hi>4.2.</hi>

For again, if the pravity and obliquity of an act is to be meaſured, and judged by the vehement and earneſt conſent of the will, then the ſin which is committed with ſo much reluctancy, will prove yet more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and of a higher nature, then thoſe we fall into, when we heard no voice behinde us to call us back; For here the will of the ſinner is ſtubborn, and perverſe, and makes haſt to the forbidden object againſt all oppoſition whatſoever, againſt the voice of the Law, which is now loud againſt him, againſt the motions of the ſpirit, which he ſtrives to repell, againſt the clamors of Conſcience,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:59296:193"/> which he heares and will not hear, even againſt all the Artillery of Heaven: it doth not yeeld to the tentation, when no voice is heard: but of the tempter, nothing diſcover'd, but the beauty and allurement of the object, nor upon ſtrategeme, or ſurpriſals, but it yeelds againſt the thunder of the Law, and dictate of Conſcience; admits ſin, not in its Beauty and glory, when it is dreſt up with advantage, and comes toward us ſmiling to flatter and wooe us, but it joyns with it, when it is clothed with death, when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by conſcience, and hung round about with all the curſes of the Law; Swallows down ſin, not when it is as ſweet as honey, but when it hath a mixture and full taſte of the bitterneſſe of Gall, and ſo though our ſin be againſt our conſcience, yet it is not againſt our will, and therefore is the more voluntary.</p>

                     </note> We come now to the laſt pretenſe, which is commonly taken up by men, who are willing to be evill, but not willing to goe under that name; and we ſhall but touch it; for it will ſoon fall to pieces with a Touch. And this pretence is made up of a bad will, and a good Intention, or meaning; which is indeed of a Good <hi>will</hi> and a bad; the one being levell'd on the end, the other on the means that lead unto it, and the one is ſet up to commend and Authorize the other; for, as ſome think, if the end be faire, it caſts a beauty and luſtre upon the way that leads to it; though it be as foule as ſinne can make it; and then, when our Will is evill, it is not evill, becauſe it looks further then that evill, to ſomething that is ſo good, that by its vertue it will transforme, and change the nature of it, and make it like unto it ſelf. And, if we look into the world, we ſhall find that nothing hath deceived men more, nothing hath wrought more miſchief on the Earth, then a groundleſſe thought, that that muſt needs pleaſe God, which is done to a good end, with a good mind, and an Ardent Affection and zeal, That of the two Tables, we may break the one, to ſecure and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the other, that we may ſerve God, when we break his will, and honour him, when we deface his Image; that that ſin, which may Damne a ſoule (and the leaſt may doe that) is not conſiderable, if we carry it along but in our hopes, to that End, which we have ſet out with the fair title of Good, though it may ſometimes be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſinne, then that which we would make uſe of, to raiſe it up. But we muſt ſuppoſe it good; but yet wee cannot think it can have ſuch a ſtrange, and more then Omnipotent virtue to change every thing, even that, which is moſt contrary to it, into its ſelf, or to make Things not to be what they are, or at the ſame time to be both good and Evill. This is but a Sophiſme, but a cheat put upon us by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; for there be two things to make up a good Intention, or elſe it is not good; Firſt it muſt be levell'd to a right and warrantable end, and then carried to it in a due and orderly courſe, by thoſe means which are fitted and proportioned to that end; and ſure ſinne is ſo
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:59296:194"/> unlike to that which is good, that it were eaſier to diſſolve the Earth, and then ſet it upon its pillars againe, then to draw them to ſuch a ſubordination, as to ſerve to advance one another; what a ſtrange ſight would it be, to ſee ſuch a figge grow on ſuch a Thiſtle, to ſee one evill Spirit drive out another, which commonly brings in ſeven worſe then himſelf; to ſee Religion brought into the World upon the Devills ſhoulders?

Original weakneſſe is an Article of our Creed, and it is our Apologie, but 'tis the Apologie of the worſt; of the covetous, of the ambitious, of the wanton, when 'tis the luſt of the eyes, that buries the covetous in the earth, the luſts of the fleſh,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59296:196"/> that ſets the wanton on fire, the <hi>pride of life,</hi> that makes the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious climb ſo high, <hi>prima haec elementa,</hi> theſe are the firſt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; theſe are their Alphabet; they learn from their Parents, they learn from their friends, they learn from ſervants to raiſe a bank, to enoble their name, to delight themſelves in the things of this world; theſe they are taught, and they have their <hi>method</hi> drawn to their hands; by theſe evil words, which are the proper Language and Dialect of the world, their manners are corrupted, and for this our father <hi>Adam</hi> is brought to the bar, when 'tis Mammon, <hi>Venus,</hi> and the world that have bruiſed us more, then his fall could do.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, pretend not the <hi>want of Grace;</hi> for a Chriſtian cannot commit a greater ſoloeciſme, then to pretend the want of that, which hath been ſo often offered, which he might have had if he would; or to conceive, that God ſhould be unwilling he ſhould do his will, unwilling he ſhould repent and turn unto him. This is a charge, as well as a pretenſe, even a charge againſt God, for bidding us riſe up and walk when we were lame, and not affording us a ſtaff, or working a miracle. Grace is of that nature, that we may want it, though it be not denied, we may want it, when we have it; and indeed we want Grace as the covetous man wants money, we want it becauſe we will not uſe it, and ſo we are ſtarved to death with bread in our hands; for if we will not eat our daily bread, we muſt die.</p>
                  <p>And in the next place, let us not ſhut up our ſelves in our own darkneſſe, nor plead ignorance of that, which we were bound to know; which we do know, and will not: which is written with the Sun-beams, which we cannot ſay we ſee not, when we may run and read it.

                  <p>Laſt of all; do not think thy action is not evil, becauſe thy inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was good; for it is as eaſie to fix a good intention upon an evil action, as 'tis to ſet a fair and promiſing title on a box of poiſon; hay and ſtubble may be laid upon a good foundation, but it will neither head well, or bed well, as they ſay, in the work of the Lord, we muſt look as well to what we build as the <hi>Baſis</hi> we raiſe, and ſet it on, or elſe it will not ſtand and abide, we ſee what a fire good intentions have kindled on the earth, and we are told that many of them burn in Hell. I may intend to beat down Idolatry, and bury Religion in the ruins of that which I beat down; I may intend the eſtabliſhing of a Conmmon-wealth, and ſhake the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it; I may intend the Reformation of a Church, and fill it with Locuſts and Caterpillars innumerable: I may intend the Glory of God, and do that, for which <hi>his Name ſhall be evil ſpoken of;</hi> and it will prove but a poor plea, when we blaſphemed him, to ſay we did it for his Glory.</p>
                  <p>Let us then lay aſide theſe Apologies, for they are not Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, but Accuſations, and detain us longer in our evil wayes, then the falſe beauty, and deceitful promiſes of a temptation could, which we ſhould not yeeld to ſo often, did not theſe betray us, nor be fools ſo long, if we had not ſomething to ſay for our ſelves.</p>

To ſay, ſhe is <hi>the Body of Chriſt filled with him, who filleth all things,</hi> is to ſet her up as a marke for the World, and the Devill to ſhoot at; and this, To ſet her up as a marke, is to build her up into a Church: ſo that, Though perſecution comes forth in ſeverall ſhapes, with more or leſs Terror, yet to ſay the Church is ever free from all, is as full of Abſurdity, as to ſay; A man may live without a ſoul.</p>
               <p>But now, take it with all its Horror, accompanied with whips and Scorpions, with fire and ſword; yet is it ſo farre from the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true Church, That it rather eſtabliſhes, enlarges and Adorns her. For the Church of Chriſt, and the Kingdomes of the Earth, are not of the ſame making, and Conſtitution, have not the ſame ſoule and Spirit to animate them: Theſe may ſeem to be built upon Aire, they are ſo ſoon thrown down; This is rais'd upon a Holy Hill; Theſe have a weake and fraile hand to ſet them up, and as
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:59296:202"/> weak a hand may caſt them downe; This is the work of Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, which fences it about, and ſecures it from Death and Hell: Theſe depend upon the Opinions, upon the affections, upon the luſts of men, which change oftner then the wind; upon the breath of that Monſter, the Multitude, which is any thing, and which is nothing, which is, it knows not what, and never agrees with it ſelf, is never <hi>one,</hi> but in a Tempeſt, in Tumult and Sedition; This is founded upon the eternall Decree, and will of GOD, and upon <hi>Immutability</hi> it ſelf, and ſhall ſtand faſt for ever: Theſe when they are in their height and glory, are under uncertainty and chance, The Church under the wing and ſhadow of that Providence, which can neither erre, nor miſcarry, but worketh mightily, and irriſiſtibly to its end. <hi>His evertendis una dies, Hora, momentum ſufficit,</hi> Theſe are long a rayſing, and are blowne downe in a moment, but this is as everlaſting as his love, that built it; in a word, theſe are worne out by Time; This is but melted and purged in it, and ſhall then be moſt Glorious, when Time ſhail be no more.</p>
               <p>I know well; Perſecution appears to us as a Fury ſent from Hell, and every Haire, every Threat is a Snake, that Hiſſeth at us; but 'tis our ſenſuality, and Cowardize that whips us; yet, the common conſent of all men hath given her a fairer ſhape, and they that run from her, doe preferre the ſuffering part, and as our Saviour ſaid, It <hi>is more bleſſed to Give, then to Receive,</hi> ſo is it <hi>vox Populi,</hi> The voice of the People (though they practice it not) It is better to ſuffer, then to Oppreſſe; even they who have the ſword in their Hand, and breath nothing but Terror and Death, will rage yet more, if you ſay, They perſecute you; and either magnify their Cruelty with the name of Juſtice, or elſe ſeek to perſwade the world, that they, and they alone ſuffer Perſecution.

If the Truth have no more Power over us, if we have no more love for the Truth, but this, which hath nothing but the name of Love, but is indeed the contrary; if we bleſſe it with our Tongue, and fight againſt it with our Luſts, at once embrace and ſtifle it, then thoſe ſenſuall Luſts, which in time of Peace did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine, and keep it under, will be the ſame, and ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againe in Time of Perſecution, and be as forcible to deterre us from thoſe Evills, which are ſo, but in ſhew and appearance, as they were before to plunge us in thoſe of ſin, which were true and reall; If we love not the truth, we are <hi>Iſmaels,</hi> and not <hi>Iſaacs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every uncleane Beaſt is not fitt to make a Sacrifice, nor the hairy ſcalp of him that goes on in his ſinnes fitt for the Crowne of Martyrdome; for how ſhall hee, who drawes out his life in Open Hoſtility to Chriſt, and trifles with him, and contemnes him all his Dayes, ſuffer or die for him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Repentance, and Reconciliation, which is indeed in the very Act of Hoſtility? ſhall wee ſeek for Heaven in Hell? or ſhall wee ſeek for witneſſes to the Truth amongſt a Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Vipers?

Can <hi>Iſmael,</hi> in the twinkling of an Eye, bee made an <hi>Iſaac?</hi> I will not ſay, It is Impoſsible, but it carries but little ſhew of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie; and if it be ever done, it is not to be brought in <hi>cenſum ordinariorum,</hi> nor falls out in the Ordinary courſe that is ſet, and is to bee lookt upon as a Miracle, which is not wrought every day, but at certain times, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome important occaſion, and to ſome eſpecial end; for it is very rare and unuſual, that conſcience ſhould be quiet and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſo long, and then on the ſudden, be as the mighty voice of

               <p>If then thou wilt ſtand up againſt Iſrael, be ſure to be an <hi>Iſaac,</hi> a childe of promiſe, and an heir to the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> if thou wilt be ſecure from the fleſh, be renewed in the ſpirit, if thou wilt be fit to take up the croſſe, firſt crucifie thy ſelf, thy luſts, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, if thou wilt be prepared againſt perſecution, firſt raiſe one in thy own breſt, ſmother every idle thought, ſilence every loud deſire, check and correct thy wanton ſancy, beat down every thing, that ſtands in oppoſition to the truth; Be thus dead unto thy ſelf; and then neither death nor life, neither fear of death, nor hope of life ſhall be ever able to ſeparate thee from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus.

               <p>Secondly, by our patience and long ſuffering: For patience worketh more miracles then power; it giveth us thoſe goods, which our enemies take from us, it makes diſhonour glorious, it dulleth the edge of the ſword, it cooleth the flames of fire, it wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth cruelty, ſhames the Devil, and like a wiſe Captain turns the Ordnance, upon the face of the enemy. <note place="margin">Rom. 5.3.</note> Patience is the proper ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of faith (for if we beleeve him who hath told us our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what will we not ſuffer for his ſake?) and it is omnipotent, <note place="margin">Philip. 4.13.</note> by the virtue of which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſes, he could do and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all things.

                  <p>And firſt, the difference between his Dominion, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the world is ſeen not onely in the Authors, but the Laws themſelves; for the Laws of men are enacted many times <hi>nec quid, nec quare,</hi> and no reaſon can be given why they are enacted, good reaſon there is why there ſhould be Laws made againſt them, and they aboliſhed; ſome written in blood, too rigid and cruel, ſome in water ready to vaniſh, many of them but the reſults and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of mens luſts, and wilde affections, made not to ſafeguard any State, but their own. But his are pure and undefiled, exact, and perfect, ſuch as tend to perfection, to the good of his Subjects, and will make them like unto this Lord, heires together with him of eternity of bliſſe, and as the reward is eternal, ſo are they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, the ſame to day, and to the end of the world, not like the Laws of the Heathen, which were raiſed with one breath, and pull'd down by another, which were fixed by one hand, and torn down by a ſecond <hi>Licurgi leges emendatae,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tert.

Thus it is with the Laws of men, but the Laws of this our Lord and Law-giver can no more change, then he that made them; no bribe can buy out their power, no diſpenſations wound them, no power can diſanul them, <note place="margin">Diſpenſationes vulnera legum.</note> but they are the ſame, and of the ſame countenance, they moult not a feather, they alter not in one circumſtance, but direct the Obedient, and ſtare the offender in the face, and by the power of this Lord kindle a Hell in him in this life, and will appear at the great day, to accuſe him; for we either ſtand or fall in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to theſe Laws; in a word, humane Lawes are made for certain Climates, and fitted to the complexion and temper of certain Common-wealths, but theſe for the whole world: <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Britanny,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> all places are bound alike, and as his Dominion, ſo his Laws reach from one end of the earth to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and theſe which he publiſht at the firſt, are not onely Laws, but promiſes and pledges of his ſecond coming, for he made them not for nought, but hath left them with us, till he come again in Glory to judge both the quick and the dead, according to his Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the Laws of men are too narrow, and cannot reach the whole Body of ſin, cannot comprehend all, not the inward man, <note place="margin">Leges non om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt, non omnia vetant, nec ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvunt.

How many are there who are called Chriſtians, who yet have not made good their title to that honour, which we give to a juſt man? How many count themſelves juſt men, yet do thoſe things, which themſelves, if they would be themſelves, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denm as moſt unjuſt, and do ſo, when others do them? and how many have carried ſo much honeſty with them into hell? the Law, of men cannot reach home to carry us to that height of innocency, to which on other Law but that within us, might lift us up; but the Lawes of this Lord, like his power and providence, reach and comprehend all, the very looks, and profers, and thoughts of the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:59296:213"/> minde, which no man ſees, which we ſee not our ſelves, which though they break not the peace, nor ſhake any pillar of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth (for a thought troubles no heart, but that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it) yet it ſtands in oppoſition to that policy which this our Lord hath drawn out, and to that end, for which he is our Lord, and is louder in his ears, then an evil word in ours, and therefore he looks not onely on our outward guilt but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience it ſelf; and pierceth to the dividing aſunder of the ſoul and the ſpirit, regulates the very thoughts and intents of the heart, which he looks upon, not as fading and vaniſhing characters in the ſoul, but as killing letters imprinted and engraven there, as S. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſpeaks, as full and compleat actions wrought out in the inward man (Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> calls them <hi>paſsivas actiones</hi> paſſive actions) which he will Judge <hi>ſecundum evangelium,</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, that he is a Lord appears by the vertue, and power of his dominion; for whereas all the power on earth (which ſo often dazles us) can but afflict the body, this wounds the ſoul, rips up the very heart, and bowels, and when thoſe Lords, (which we ſo tremble at, till we fall from him) can but kill the body; This Lord can caſt both ſoul and body into Hell; nay, can make us a Hell unto our ſelves, make us puniſh and torment our ſelves, and being greater then our conſcience can multiply thoſe ſtrokes. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane laws have been brought into diſgrace, becauſe they had not power enough to attend and hold them up, and even the common people, who fear them moſt, have by their own obſervation ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the boldneſſe to call them cobwebs; for they ſee, he that hath a full purſe, or a good ſword will ſoon break through them, or finde a beeſom to ſweep them away. What ſpeak you of the Laws? I can have them, and binde them up <hi>in ſudariolo,</hi> ſaith <hi>Damianus,</hi> in the corner of my Handkerchief, nay, many times for want of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>victae leges</hi> the Laws muſt ſubmit as in conqueſt, and though they have a tongue to ſpeak, yet they have not a hand to ſtrike. And as it is in puniſhment, ſo it is ſometimes in point of reward; men may raiſe their mer it &amp; deſerts ſo high, that the Exchecquer it ſelf ſhall not finde a reward to equal them. We have a ſtory in our own Chronicles, of a Noble-man, who did ſuch ſervice for his friend, then but a private man, that he made him firſt a Conqueror, then a king: the Hiſtorian gives this note, that kings love not to be too much beholding to their Subjects, nor to have greater ſervice done, then they are able to reward, and ſo (how truly I know not) makes the ſetting on of the Crown on his friends head one cauſe of the loſing of his own. But it is not ſo with this our Lord, who being now in his throne of Majeſty, cannot be outdared by any ſin, be it never ſo great, never ſo common, and can break the hairy ſcalp of the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:59296:213"/> moſt Gyant-like offender, and ſhiver in pieces the talleſt Cedar in <hi>Libanus.</hi> Who ſhall be able to ſtand up in his ſight?

                  <p>Again, he hath rewards, and his Treaſurie is full of them; Not onely a Cup of cold water, but the powring forth my blood as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the Truths ſake, ſhall have its full and overflowing Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, nor ſhall there ever any be able to ſay, what profit is it that we have kept his Laws?

All other Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath its bounds and limits, which it cannot paſſe, but by violence and the ſword, nor is it expedient for the world to have one King, nor for the Church to have one Univerſall Biſhop, or, as they ſpeak, one viſible Head. For as a ſhip may be made up to that bulke, that it cannot bee managed; ſo the number of men, and diſtance of place may be ſo great, that it cannot ſubſiſt under one Government.

                  <p>We muſt now fix our eyes upon him, as ready to deſcend, <hi>in puncto reverſus,</hi> ſettled in his place, but upon his return, <hi>Dominus venturus,</hi> the Lord will come, it is a word of the future tenſe, as all predictions are of things to come, and it is <hi>verbum operativum,</hi> a word full of eſhcacie, and vertue. Firſt, to awake and ſtir up our faith. Secondly, to raiſe our hope; and Thirdly to inflame our charity. It is an object for our faith to look on, for our hope to reach at, and for our Charity to embrace.</p>
                  <p>And firſt it offers it ſelf to our faith; for <hi>ideo Deus alſceſsit, ut fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des noſtra corroboretur,</hi> therefore doth our Saviour ſtay, and not bow the heavens, and come down, that our faith which may reach him there, may be built up here upon earth, and he is therefore abſent, and in a manner lies hid, that this eye might finde him out; For faith is a kinde of proſpective or optick Inſtrument, by which we ſee things afar off, as if they were neer at hand; things that are not yet, as if they were, turns <hi>venturus eſt,</hi> into the preſent tenſe, behold Chriſt not onely ſitting at the right hand of God, but as now already deſcending with a ſhout: With this eye of faith, I ſee new Heavens, and a new earth, a new face of every thing, I ſee what a nothing, that is, which mortals ſweat, and fight for; what a nothing the world is; for I ſee it on fire; I ſee righteouſneſſe, peace, and order, conſtancy, duration, even whilſt I walk in this ſhop of vanities, this <hi>World of wickedneſſe,</hi> this Chaos, and confuſion; this ſeat of change; I ſee honeſty pittied, ſcorn'd, baffled, honeſty lifted up on high, far above reproach or injury; I ſee injuſtice powerful, all conquering, Triumphant injuſtice trembling before this Lord, arraigned, condemned, flung down into the loweſt pit, there to be whipt with many ſtripes: I ſee now the wiſdom of men
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:59296:219"/> made fooliſhneſſe, and the fooliſhneſſe of God wiſer then men; I ſee that reſtored, which I ſaw loſt; I ſee the eye that was bored out, in its prace again, I ſee the plowed back, with no furrow on it; I ſee <hi>Herod</hi> in priſon, and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> with his head on; I ſee my goods reſtored, before I loſe them, and I am in heaven, before the blow is given, in bliſſe when every eye doth pitty me, and what is now left for the boaſting Tyrant to do? what can he take from me, that is worth a thought? what can he ſtrip me of, but that which I have laid down, and left already behinde me? will he have my goods? the treaſurie where they are kept, is out of his reach; will he take from me my good name? Tis written in the book of life; or will he take my life? my life? he cannot; For 'tis <hi>hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> This is <hi>ſancta impudentia Fidei,</hi> the holy boldneſſe, and confidence of faith to break through fleſh and blood, all difficulties whatſoever, to draw down Heaven to earth, and if the object be inviſible, to make it viſible, if it be at diſtance to make it preſent, if the Lord ſay, he will come, to faith he is come already. This operation faith will have, if it be not dull'd, and deaded by our ſenſuality: for what faith is that, which is not accompanied with theſe high appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, and reſolutions equal to them? what faith is that which leaves us weary of the truth, and aſhamed of our profeſſion? what faith is that, which we are ſo ready at every frown to renounce? ſhall I call that faith which cannot ſtrike the Timbrel out of our hands, nor the ſtrumpet out of our armes? That ſhews Chriſt coming to the Covetous, yet leaves him digging in the earth; to the ambitious, and cannot ſtop him in his mount? to the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, and cannot ſtrike off his mask, to the Polititian and cannot make him wiſe unto Salvation? that cannot make us diſpleaſe our ſelves, that cannot make us love our ſelves, not awe an eye, not binde a hand, not ſilence a word, not ſtifle a thought, but leaves us with as little power, and activity as they who have been dead long agoe, although the <hi>venturus eſt,</hi> the Doctrine of Chriſts ſecond Advent ſound as loud as the Trump ſhall do at the laſt day? faith ſhall we call this, or a weak, and faint perſwaſion, or a dream? or an Echo from an hollow heart, which when all the <hi>World proclaimes it venturus eſt, he will come,</hi> reſounds it back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into the world? a faith which can ſpeak, but not walk, or work, a faith which may dwell in the heart of an Hypocrite, a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, a Devil? for all this he may beleeve or at leaſt profeſſe, and yet be that liar, that Antichriſt, which denies Jeſus to be the Lord, or that he ever came in the fleſh, or will come again to judge both the quick and the dead.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As it caſts an Aſpect upon our Faith, ſo it doth upon hope, which <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

Hope will not raiſe it ſelfe upon every Faith, nor is that Faith (which the moſt of the world moſt depend on) a fitt Baſis for hope to build upon; even he that deſpaires, beleeves; or elſe he could not deſpair; for who will droop for fear of that <hi>veniet,</hi> of that judgement, which he is ſo willing to perſwade himſelf, will never come? Fooliſh men that we are, who hath bewitched us? that we ſhould glory in Faith an Hope, and make them the ſubjects of our Songs, and rejoycing, when our Faith is but ſuch a one, as is Dead, and our hope at laſt will make us aſhamed? when our Faith is the ſame, which is in hell, and our Hope will leave us with the Devil, and his Angels? a Faith worſe then Infidelity, and a hope more dangerous then deſpair; a Faith, when we doe not beleeve, and a Hope, when there is great reaſon wee ſhould deſpaire, and which will ſerve onely to adde to the number of our ſtripes; yet this is the Faith, this is the hope of the Hypocrite, of the Formall Chriſtian, <hi>Theſe are thy gods oh Iſrael.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">3.</note> And therefore in the laſt place, that we may joyne theſe two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, Faith and Hope, we muſt draw in that excellent gift of Charity, which is <hi>Copulatrix virtus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cyprian,</hi> the uniting, coupling Virtue, not onely of men, but of theſe two Theologicall Virtues, which will not meet together, but in Love, or if they do, with ſo little truth, and reality, that they will rather diſadvantage, then help us; for where Virtue is not, the name is but an Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I told you before, that hope doth Suppoſe Faith. For we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hope for that, which we doe not beleeve, yet Faith (ſuch as it may be) may ſhew it ſelf, and ſpeak proud words, when Charity is Thruſt out of Doores, and many there be, who have ſubſcribed to the <hi>venturus eſt,</hi> that the Lord will come, who have little reaſon to hope for his coming: How many beleeve, hee will come, and bring his reward with him, and yet ſtrike off their own Charriot wheels, and drive but heavily towards it? how many beleeve there is a Judge to come, and wiſh there were none? Faith; Saving Faith, Hope, Hope that will not make aſhamed, cannot dwell in the heart
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:59296:220"/> till Charity hath taken up a roome; but when ſhe is <hi>diffuſa in cordibus,</hi> ſhed, and ſpread abroad in our Hearts, then they are in Conjunction, and meet together, and kiſſe each other, Faith is a Foundation, and on it our love raiſeth it ſelf as high as heaven in all the ſeverall branches and parts of it: Becauſe I beleeve, I love, and when my love is reall and perfect, my hope ſprings up, and blooms, and flouriſhes: my Faith ſees the object, my Love imbraceth it, and the means unto it, and my Hope layes hold of it, and even takes poſſeſsion of it. And therefore this <hi>venturus eſt,</hi> This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord is a Threat, and not a promiſe, if they meet not: If Faith work not by Love; and both together raiſe not a Hope, <hi>ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus eſt, he will come,</hi> is a Thunder-bolt; And thus, as it lookes upon Faith and Hope, ſo it calls for our Charity; For whether we will or no, whether we beleeve or no, whether we hope or no, <hi>veniet,</hi> he will certainly come, but when we love him, then we <hi>love alſo his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and his coming,</hi> and our Love is a ſubſcription to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8.</note> by which we truly Teſtify our conſent, and ſympathize with him, and ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> to his Promiſe, That he will come, we eccho it back againe unto him, Even ſo, come Lord Jeſus: For that of Faith may be in a manner forc'd, That of Hope may be groundleſs, but this of Love is a free, and voluntary ſubſcription. Though I I know he will come, yet I ſhall be unwilling he ſhould come upon me, as an Enemy, that he ſhould come to me when I ſit in the Chair of the Scornfull, or lie in the bed of Luſt, or am wallowing in the mire, or weltring in my own blood, or waſhing my feet in the blood of my Brethren; for can any condemned perſon hope for the day of Execution? But when I love him, and bow before him, when I have improv'd his Talent, and brought my ſelf to that Temper, and Conſtitution, that I am of the ſame mind with this Lord, and <hi>parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of his divine Nature,</hi> then Faith openeth, and diſplayeth her ſelf, and Hope towreth up as high, as the right Hand of God, and would bring him down, never at reſt, never at an end, but panting after him, till he doe come, crying out with the ſoules under the Altar, <hi>How long Lord?

Now theſe arguments, and occaſions are that, which we call temptations; which though they naturally light upon the outward man, yet do they formally aime at the inward, and are nothing, do nothing, till they ſeiſe upon the will, which may either joyn with the ſenſitive part, againſt the reaſon, which makes us to every <hi>good work</hi> reprobate; or elſe joyn with our reaſon againſt our ſenſual appetite, which works in us, a conformity to the will of God; for he wills nothing to be done which right reaſon will not have us do. The will is that alone, which draws, and turns theſe temptations, either to a good end, by watchfulneſſe and care; or by ſupine negligence, turns them to a bad; turnes them from that end, for which they were permitted, and ordained, and ſo makes Satans darts more fiery, his enterpriſes more ſubtle; his occaſions more powerful, and his perſwaſions more perſwaſive, then indeed they are: ſo that what God ordained for our trial, and crown, by our ſecurity and neglect, is made a means to bring on our downfall, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>We muſt therefore in the midſt of temptations, as in a School, learn to know our ſelves; and in the next place, <hi>to know our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> and now they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And firſt, we may lay it as a ground; That nothing properly provoketh it ſelf, as the fire doth not provoke it ſelf to burn nor the Sun to ſhine; for the next and neceſſary cauſes of things, are rather efficients, then provocations, which are alwayes external either to the perſon, or principal, or part, which is the principal and ſpecial agent; and ſo the will of man doth conſummate, and finiſh ſin, but provoketh it not, but is enticed to that evil, or frighted from that which is good, by ſome outward object, which firſt preſents it ſelf unto the ſenſe, which carries it to the fancy,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:59296:233"/> which conveighs it to the underſtanding, whence ariſeth that fight, and contention between the inferior part of the ſoul, and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, between the ſenſual appetite and the reaſon, not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided, or determined but by the will, and when the will like <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> holdeth up its hands, as it were, and is ſteady and ſtrong, the reaſon prevaileth, and when it lets them down, the ſenſe. The ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes then are, (as <hi>Hierom</hi> calls them) <hi>feneſtra animae,</hi> the windows of the ſoul, through which tentations enter to flatter and wooe the fancie and affections, to joyn with the principal faculties of the ſoul, to beget that ſin, which begetteth death, and if you will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how they work by the ſenſes upon the ſoul, you will ſoon finde that they do it not, by force and battery, but by allurement, and ſpeaking it faire, or elſe by frowns and terrors; that there is no ſuch force in their arguments which ſpiritual wiſdome, and vigilancy may not aſſoile; that there is no ſuch beauty on them, which may not be loathed, no ſuch horror, which we may not ſlight and contemn.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, they work us occaſions of ſin: and all the power, that occaſion hath, is but to ſhew it ſelf, and if it kill, it is as the <hi>Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisk,</hi> by the eye, by looking towards us, or indeed, rather by our looking towards it.

Honor, and Riches, and love of this world make up that body of Divinity, which muſt be a Directory for others to walk by, the eye reads the Text, and the eye lets in the Interpretation; for the love that I delight in, is urgent with me, and perſwades me to underſtand it ſo, as it may fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Countenance that Love.</p>

For if I could not be angry, I could not be meek: If I had no deſire, I could not be chaſt; if I were void of fear, I could not watch, if I could not rebel, I could not obey; if I could not be evil, I could not be good; if I had no inclination to vice, I could not be vertuous: for this is the work of reaſon, and vertue, to ſubdue, and regulate this inclination, to draw it unto good, which might have been miſlead, and carried unto evil, and our watchfulneſſe conſiſts in this, in making that uſeful, which may be hurtful, in making that a friend which might have been an enemy, in taking the danger out of an inclination, the ſting out of a temptation, and with it the victory. What can we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble God more then in the deſtruction of ſin? and this we may do by the help of our paſſions; my joy ſings Pſalmes to him, my fear obſerves him, and trembles before him; my anger reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his quarrel; when my indignation is againſt my ſelf; my ſorrow payes him the tribute of tears; my love haſteth with a ſteady eye to that which is good, when that is preſent, it is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into joy, when to come, 'tis quickned into hope, when 'tis paſt, 'tis poured forth into deſire; all natural inclinations may be brought to work for our good, and the glory of God that gave them.</p>

               <p>Or more plainly this; If being an Apoſtle of Chriſt, I <hi>ſhould yet

               </p>
               <p>And in this ſenſe, if you view the <hi>form and manner</hi> of the words, they are at the firſt found, but a meer <hi>ſuppoſition</hi> of S. <hi>Pauls;</hi> but if we hear them again, and well obſerve and conſider them, we ſhal find them to bea ſatyre, and bitter reprehenſion of thoſe falſe Apoſtles, who did mingle and confound Chriſt and the Law; and all thoſe who ſhall leave the truth behinde them, to meet and comply with the humours of men; I ſay, a plain and flat redargution, but clothed in the Garment and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Again, as it is an <hi>artiſicial reprehenſion,</hi> ſo if you ſhall pleaſe to look upon it intentively, you ſhall finde it to be a <hi>rale and precept.</hi> For as ſome commentators on <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> have obſerved, that his rule many times is contained, and lies hid in the example and inſtance which he brings; as when he gives you the inſtance of a <hi>magnificent man,</hi> you ſhall there eaſily diſcover the face and beauty, and full proportion of magnificence, ſo what Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, laies down as a <hi>ſuppoſition,</hi> is indeed a rule <hi>and precept.</hi> And this which hath been obſerved of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> is the conſtant method of the holy Ghoſt, that which is brought for inſtance, is a precept, when <hi>Joſuah</hi> ſpeakes of himſelf, <note place="margin">Joſh. 24.15.</note> I, <hi>and my houſhold will ſerve the Lord,</hi> he draws the character of a good Maſter of a Family.

And here, <hi>ſi adhuc placerem, if yet I pleaſed men, I were not the ſervant of Chriſt,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks it of himſelf, but it is a command given to all thoſe, who have given up their name unto Chriſt, and every man may make this deduction to himſelf, that <hi>to pleaſe men</hi> and <hi>ſerve Chriſt</hi> are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

               <p>And then, theſe three things are wrapt up in this ſuppoſition. Firſt, our <hi>Apoſtles purgation of himſelf;</hi> that he is none.

               </p>
               <p>Or thus: here is ſomthing <hi>implied,</hi> and ſomthing plain and <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;</hi> that which is <hi>implied</hi> is, that moſt men are willing to be pleaſed; that which is plain and poſitive, is, that there be others, that will be too ready to pleaſe them. And then the parts will be three. 1. We ſhall diſcover the humour, the <hi>deſire of being pleaſed,</hi> and the danger of it. 2. A humour, which is <hi>ready to meet, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this;</hi> an art, and readineſſe of pleaſing others, of knowing their taſte and palate, and diſhing out their inſtructions with ſuch ſawces which ſhall delight them; in making their addreſſes to them in that ſhape, and poſture, which they moſt love to look upon, and are ready to welcome and reward; and caſt off all the <hi>Huge diſtance, and inconſiſtency</hi> which is between theſe two, the <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of men, and the being a ſervant of Chriſt,</hi> and of theſe we ſhall ſpeak plainly in their order.</p>

               </q>
               <p>And firſt we need not doubt, that moſt men <hi>deſire to be pleaſed,</hi> and it may ſeem a needleſſe labour to go about to prove it, for do but whiſper, do but breath againſt their humour, and you have made a demonſtration, that it is ſo. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> indeed makes it his wonder at the 6. v. <hi>miror quod tam citò, I wonder that you are ſo ſoon removed;</hi> and we might well wonder at his wonder, but that his <hi>miror</hi> carries with it more of reproof then admiration; for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this humour, this deſire to be pleaſed takes off our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and when we have diſcovered this, we ceaſe to wonder, into a barren ſoile, from the Goſpel of Chriſt, which bringeth ſalvation, but withall trouble to the fleſh, to another Goſpel, which is no Goſpel, but excludeth both; in a word, to ſee men begin <hi>in the ſpirit, and end in the fleſh Omnis rei diſplicentis etiam opinio reprobatur,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tert.</hi> The very thought of that, which diſpleaſes us, diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes us almoſt as much as the thing it ſelf; for indeed it is nothing but thought that troubles us, and it is not the matter or ſubſtance of truth, but opinion, and our private humour which makes truth
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:59296:243"/> ſuch a bitter pill, that we cannot take it down. It was the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſpeech of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great to his Maſter <hi>Ariſtotle, Doce me facilia;</hi> leave, I pray you, your knotty and intricate diſcourſes, and teach me thoſe things which are eaſy, which the underſtanding may not labour under; but ſuch as it may receive with delight: and it is ſo with us in the ſtudy of that art of arts, which alone can make us both wiſe and happy, we love not <hi>duros Sermones,</hi> thoſe hard and harſh leſſons which diſcipline the fleſh, and bring it into ſubjection, and demoliſh thoſe ſtrong holds, which it hath ſet up, and in which it truſteth; a <hi>Paraſite</hi> is more welcome to us, then a <hi>Prophet:</hi> he is our Apoſtle, who will bring thoſe familiar and beloved arguments to perſwade us to that, to which we have perſwaded our ſelves already, and further our motion to that, to which we are flying; we finde almoſt the parallel in the 30. of <hi>Eſai.</hi> 10. v. of thoſe, who ſay to the <hi>Seers,</hi> ſee not; <hi>loquimini placen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, Propheſie not unto us right things,</hi> but <hi>Propheſie deceits,</hi> men who had rather be coſen'd with a pleaſing lie, then ſaved with a frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and threatning truth, rather be wounded to death with a kiſſe, then be rowſed with noiſe, rather die in a pleaſant dream, then be awaked to ſee the pit opening her mouth, and even ſpeaking to them to fly, and ſave themſelves from deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>I am appeal to your eye, and tender you that, which your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation muſt needs have taken up before, both at home in your ſelves, and abroad in others; for he that doth but open his eyes, and look into the world; will ſoon conceive it as a common ſtage, where every man treads his meaſures for approbation, and applauſe; where every man acts his part, walks as a <hi>Paraſite</hi> to himſelf; and all men one to another: that is, do the ſame, which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did after the molten Calf, <note place="margin">Exob. 32.27.</note> 
                  <hi>ſlay every man his brother, and every man his Neighbour, and every man his Companion,</hi> every man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ready executioner in this kinde, and every man ready, and willing to die. We will therefore in the next place, ſearch this evil humour, this deſire of being pleaſed, and we ſhall be the willinger to be purged of it, if either we conſider the cauſes from which it proceeds, or the bitter effects, which it produceth.</p>

And ſo it falls out in the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of our ſpirituall eſtate, we doe as the Apoſtle exhorts (though not to this end) caſt away every Thing, that <hi>preſſeth down,</hi> but ſo caſt it away, as to leave it heavier then before, preferr a momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſe, which we begg, or borrow, or force from Things without us, before that Peace, which nothing can bring in, but that griefe, and ſerious Repentance, which we put off with hands and words, as as a Thin irkſome, and unpleaſing; For could we be ſick, we might be well; did not we love our diſeaſe, we might ſhake it off; but we are ſick, and will be ſo; there is ſomething wanting, and a ſupply is our ſhame, being an Argument of that defect, which we are unwilling to acknowledge, a Phyſitian doth but upbraid us, and ſelves in our Diſeaſe, as in health it ſelf, and had rather languiſh and Dye, then be told we are ſick.</p>
               <p>And this (in the Second place) proceeds even from the force and power of Conſcience within us, which, if we will not hearken to it as a Friend, will Turne Fury, and purſue and laſh us, and if we

Now every thing that is oppreſſed, doth naturally deſire eaſe, and ſo doe they, and finding it a labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing to quiet the Conſcience, which cannot be done but by yeelding and bowing our backs to her whip, and running from our ſelves, from thoſe ſinnes, which pleaſed our ſenſe, but enraged our Conſcience; we ſeek out many inventions, and advance our ſinnes againſt her, till they prevail, and even put her to ſilence. For in evill men, the worſt part doth the office of the better, corrupts the Records, mitigates the ſentence, pronounceth life in Death: The ſenſuall part is their Conſcience, their God, it bids them doe this, and they doe it, and when it is done, is a ready Advocate to plead for it, and defend it; It conceives and brings forth the Monſter, and then gives it what name it pleaſe: It was a crying ſinne; It hath now loſt its voice; It was uncleanneſs, it is now frailty; It was trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is now the love of our Countrey; It was perjury, It is now prudence; Riches commend Covetouſneſſe, bonor Treaſon, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure wantonneſs: That which begets ſinne, nurſeth it up, till it grow up to ſtrength to oppoſe it ſelf to Conſcience, and degrade, and put her from her Office, and bring in a Thouſand ſorry excuſes to take her place; in the midſt of which ſhe cannot be heard; not heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Riches, whoſe Sophiſtry is preferred before her Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations; not heard againſt Beauty, which bewitches us, and makes us fooles; not heard againſt Honor, which lifteth us up ſo high, that we cannot heare her; not heard againſt Power, which is the greateſt paraſite in the world, and calls in a world of Paraſites to bow before us, and bleſſe us in the Name of the Lord; and thus we are firſt pleaſed to ſinne and then are eaſily pleaſed in it; wee are in danger, and will not know it, and when the God of Iſrael is angry, heare what the God of <hi>Ekron</hi> will ſay: In a word; we raiſe a ſtorme in our ſelves, and whiſtle it downe; we wound our ſelves, and skinn it over, we are too ſoon troubled, and too ſoon eas'd, and might recover, were not our remedy more fatall then our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee this humour of being pleaſed is very predominant in moſt men; and in the <hi>Third</hi> place, as it proceeds from the power and force of Conſcience, which will ſpeak if ſhe may be Heard, and doth ſpeake, even when ſhe is not heard, ſo it doth from the luſtre and Glory of <hi>Piety and holineſſe,</hi> which ſpreads her Beames, and
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:59296:244"/> darts her Light in the very face of them, who have proſcrib'd her, ſent her a Bill of divorce, and put her away, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

How angry will a Strumpet be, if you call her ſo? Call a Phariſee a Hypocrite, and he will thruſt you out of the Synagogue. Though I bow downe before an Image, yet I am not an Idolater; though I break the bonds of Peace, yet I am not factious. Though I never have enough, yet I am not covetous; I am not evill, though I doe thoſe Things, for which we juſtly call men ſo. Our rule here is quite contrary to that known and received Axiome of the world, <hi>Malo me divitem eſſe, quam haberi;</hi> In the managing of our worldly affaires, we had rather be rich, then be accounted ſo, but in the courſe of our Religion, we are rich enough, we are good enough, if we have but the name that we are ſo; we are good enough, if none dare call us evill.</p>
               <p>And thus it is both in the Errours of our underſtanding, and of our will: In the one we think it better to pretend to knowledge, and reſt our ſelves in that, then to be taught to alter our mind, <hi>malumus didiciſſe, quam diſcere,</hi> That we know ſomething already, is our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <note place="margin">Quintil. l. <hi>3.</hi> Instit. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> but to ſubmit our ſelves to Inſtruction, is an Argument of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection; and therefore we account it a puniſhment to be Taught; And this is the reaſon, why ſo few have retracted their Errors, but rather ſtoutly defended them, even a loathneſs to ſeem to have er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which mightily reignes in moſt men but eſpecially in all preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders unto knowledge; Nature it ſelf having annexed a ſhame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe two above all other Things, which Naturally befall us, <hi>Luſt and Ignorance;</hi> for as the Italian Proverb is, A Learned Fool will be a fool ever.</p>
               <p>And ſo it is in the other; In the practick errors of our life, wee would not know our ſelves, nor have others know that we have done any thing amiſſe; <hi>qui apponit ſcientiam, apponit dolorem,</hi>

Tell a perſecuter, he is ſo, and he will rage more, and make it good upon your ſelf, deny it, and yet make it too manifeſt, That he is ſo.

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:59296:245"/> Interruption, but when it meets with any ſtop, or bank, it begins to rage and foame, and caſt up mire and dirt in their faces, who do attempt to ſtop its courſe, <hi>volumus errare,</hi> we will erre, and he is an Enemy, that tell us the truth, <hi>volumus peccare,</hi> we will ſinne, but he that tells the Sinner, <hi>Thou art the man,</hi> ſhall not be received as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> but be defied, as an Adverſary: Sinne is of a Monſtrous appearance, who can ſtand before it? and therefore we either cloud and hide it with an excuſe, or dreſſe it up in the mantle of Virtue, in the Habit, and Beauty of Holineſs, as <hi>Pompey,</hi> to commend the Theater, which he built, call'd it a Temple.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the cauſes which beget and nurſe up this evill Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in us; <hi>This deſire to be pleaſed;</hi> this unwillingneſſe to be Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, though it be to be <hi>pluckt out of the fire.</hi> 1. <hi>A defect in our ſelves,</hi> cannot fill up with righteouſneſs, we doe with the ſhadow of it; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The <hi>Power of Conſcience,</hi> which when we cannot quiet, we ſlumber, and caſt into a deep ſleep; and <hi>laſtly:</hi> the <hi>Glory and Beauty of Goodneſs,</hi> which forceth from us, though not a Complacency, yet an approbation, and makes them lay claime unto her, who have violently Thruſt her out of doores.

He whoſe wayes tend to death, when he makes moſt haſt, and even feels himſelf falling in, yet wil not tell you he is going into Hell. And this is the ſad condition of all thoſe, who will, who muſt be pleaſed, who will heare nothing that is contrary to them, that is, nothing that may help them; who are devils to themſelves, and help the Tempter to overthrow them, who never acknowledge a diſeaſe til it be incurable, never ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves but in Hell, never feel any pain, till it be eternal.</p>

                  <p>And firſt; wee cannot do both, not ſerve men, and Chriſt, no more then you can draw the ſame ſtreight line to two points, to touch them both; <hi>you cannot,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ſerve God and Mammon.</hi> One Maſter may have many ſervants, but one ſervant cannot have many Maſters; <hi>Imperium dividi poteſt, Amor non poteſt,</hi> Power and command may ſtretch, and ſpread, and divide it ſelf to many, but Love and Obſervance cannot be carryed, and levell'd but on one, nor can the mind, ſaith <hi>Quintilian,</hi> ſeriouſly Intend many things at once, <hi>Quocunque reſpexerit, deſinit intueri quod propoſitum fuerat,</hi> to whatſoever it turnes it ſelf, it turnes from that which it firſt lookt upon, and loſeth one Engagement in another, becauſe it cannot fitt and apply it ſelf to both. How then can one and the ſame man beſtow himſelf upon Chriſt, and upon the world? For it is not with the will and Affections, as it is with the Intellectuall facultie. The underſtanding may eaſily ſever one Thing from another, and underſtand them both, nay, it hath power to abſtract, and ſeparate Things really the ſame, and conſider them in this Difference; but it is the property of the will and Affections, <hi>in unum ferri, &amp; ſe in unitatem colligere,</hi> to collect and unite, and make it ſelf one with the Object, nor can our Deſires be carryed to two contrary Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects at one and the ſame Time: wee may apprehend Chriſt as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and Holy, and the World and Riches of it, as vanity it ſelf, but we cannot at once ſerve Chriſt as Juſt, and Holy, and love the World and the vanities thereof; Our Saviour tells us, we ſhall love the one, and hate the other, leane to the one, and deſpiſe the other; If it be a love to the one, it will be at beſt, but a liking of the other; If it a will to the one, it will be but a velleity to the other; If it be a look on the one, it will be but a glance on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:59296:251"/> And this liking this velleity, This glance are no better then diſſervice, then hatred, and Contempt: For theſe proceed from the underſtanding, but my love from my will, which is fixed, not where I approve, but where I chooſe. 'Tis eaſy to ſay, and we ſay it too often, for the Divell is ready to ſuggeſt it; 'Tis true: wee ſet our Affections upon things below, but yet ſo, That we doe not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Duties of Divine worſhip; we are willing to pleaſe men, but we doubt not, but we may pleaſe Chriſt alſo; we are indeed Time-ſervers, but we are frequent Hearers of his Word: we pour Oyle into our Brothers eares, but we drop ſometimes a Peny into the Treaſury; Thus we pleaſe others, and we pleaſe our ſelves, we betray others, and are our own Paraſites, but Chriſt is ready to ſeale up our lips with an <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

                     </note> ſaith <hi>Hilary,</hi> His divine works, his works of Love and Compaſsion had Nothing of Flattery in them: He did them not as ſeeking his owne Glory; for he had a Quire of Angels to chant his praiſe; he did them not to flatter men; for he needed not that which is ours; for the world was his, and all that therein is. Power cannot flatter, and Mercy is ſo intent on its work, that it thinks of nothing elſe; to work wonders, to pleaſe men, were the greateſt wonder of all; And thus ſhould we look upon him, and Teach our brethren, as he wrought miracles; not for prayſe, which may make us worſe; not for Riches, which may make us poorer then we were; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech them in Chriſts ſtead, and in the Perſon of Chriſt, and ſpeake like him in whoſe mouth there was neither flattery nor guile; ſpeak the Truth, though it diſpleaſe, ſpeak the Truth, though the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Rage, and the People imagine a vaine Thing; ſpeake the Truth, though, for ought we know, it may be the laſt word wee ſpeak; ſpeak the Truth, though it nayle us to the Croſſe; where we ſhall moſt reſemble him with this Title, <hi>The ſervant of Chriſt,</hi> as

                  <p>For laſtly, <note place="margin">Servus pro nullo eſt.</note> A ſervant is nothing, is no perſon in Law, hath no power of his owne, <hi>ſervitus morti aequiparatur,</hi> ſay the Civilians, a ſervant is as a Dead man, and cannot Act nor move of himſelf, but is Actuated as it were, by the Power and command of his Lord and Maſter, and never goes, but when he ſayes goe, never Doth, but what he bids him doe, and doth not interpret, but execute his Will. <hi>Non oportet villicum plus ſapere, quam Dominum,</hi> ſaith <hi>Columella;</hi> It is a moſt unfit, and diſadvantageous thing for the Farmer or Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman to be wiſer then his Lord; For when the Lord comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth one thing, and the ſervant thinks it fitter to do another, the crop and harveſt will be but Thin; and it is ſo in our ſpiritual Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry; It ſavours of too much boldneſs and preſumption, for the ſervant to be wiſer then his Maſter, and there will be but ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, when the Maſter calls for the whip, and the ſervant brings the merry Harp and the Lute, when he calls for a Talent to reckon but a mite, and when he writes a Hundred, to take the Bill, and ſet down Fifty.

               <p>And ſince the words are his, we muſt in the <hi>firſt place,</hi> look up and hearken to him who breaths forth this love; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> conſider what task his love hath ſet us, what we are <hi>to do; thirdly, ex praeſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pto agere,</hi> ſince it is an injunction, whoſe every accent is love, doe it after that form which he hath ſet down, after the manner which he hath preſcribed: So the parts are four; <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Author of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: <hi>Secondly,</hi> the duty enjoyned, <hi>to do this: Thirdly, to do it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: Laſtly,</hi> the end of the Inſtitution, or the <hi>manner</hi> how we muſt do it; we muſt do it <hi>in remembrance of him, i.e.</hi> of all thoſe benefits, and graces, and promiſes which flowed with his blood from his very heart, which was ſick with love; and with theſe we ſhall exerciſe your Chriſtian devotion at this time.</p>
               <p>And firſt, we muſt look upon the Author of the Inſtitution; for in every action we do, it is good to know by what authority we do it; and this is the very order of nature, ſaith S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>

<pb n="394" facs="tcp:59296:257"/> It may be ſaid, Is not his word ſufficient, which is able to ſave our ſouls? is it not enough for me to beat down my body, to pour forth my prayers, to crucifie my fleſh? No: nothing is ſufficient but what the authority of Chriſt hath made ſo; <hi>neſcit judicare, quiſquis didicit perfectè obedire</hi> is true in matters of this nature; we have no judgement of our own, our wiſdome is to obey, and let him alone to judge what is fit, who alone hath power to command. Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt not be diſputed with, nor can it hear <hi>why ſhould I do this?</hi> for ſuch a queſtion denies it to be authority; if it were poſſible that God, to try our obedience, ſhould bid us ſow the rocks, or water a dry ſtick, or teach a language which we do not know (as the Jeſuits do their Novices) a neceſſity would lie upon us, and woe unto us, if we did it not; how much rather then ſhould we obey, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands for our advantage; gives us a law, that he may give us more grace, binds us to that which will raiſe us neerer to him; when he ſpreads his table, prepares his viands, bids us eat and drink, and then ſayes grace; bids a bleſſing himſelf unto it, that we may grow up in his Favour, and be placed amongſt thoſe great examples of eternall happineſſe?</p>
               <p>Look not then on the <hi>Miniſter</hi> howſoever qualified, for a braſſe ſeal makes the ſame impreſſion which a ring of Gold doth, and it is not materiall whether the ſeal be of baſer or purer mettall, ſo the image and character be authentique, ſaith <hi>Nazianz.</hi> Look not on the outward elements, for of themſelves they have no power at all, no more than the water of <hi>Jordan</hi> had to cure a Leper, but their power and vertue is from above; the force and vertue of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lies in the inſtitution, all the power it hath is from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. Before it was but Bread, but common Bread, now it is Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, the bread of ſtrength, the bread of Angels; and this truth thou maiſt build upon, nor doth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> deny it; and though they have added five Sacraments, and may adde as many more as they pleaſe, <hi>Quicquid arant homines, navigant, aedificant,</hi> any thing we do may be made a Sacrament (when the fancy is working ſhe may ſpin out what ſhe pleaſe) yet they cannot deny that every Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament muſt have immediate inſtitution from Chriſt himſelf, from his own mouth, or elſe it is of no validity, and therefore are forced to pretend it, though they cannot prove it, in thoſe which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have added for their own advantage. Think then when thou heareſt theſe words, <hi>Take, eat, this is my body which was broken,</hi> thou heareſt thy Saviour himſelf ſpeaking from heaven; think not of the Miniſter, or the meanneſſe of the Elements, but think of him who took thee out of thy blood, and ſanctified thee with his, and by the ſame power is able to ſanctifie theſe outward Elements, by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of whoſe inſtitution, <hi>The cup of bleſsing,</hi> which we bleſſe, <hi>which he bleſſed firſt,</hi> ſhall be to every one that comes worthily, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion

               <p>Let us now conſider what he enjoyns us to do; and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is to <hi>do this,</hi> that is, to do as he did, though to another end, to take Bread, and to give Thanks, and eat it, and ſo of the Cup, to take and drink it; and if this be done with an eye to the Author, and a lively faith in him, this is all (for this table was ſpread not for the dead, but for the living) this, I ſay, is all: but ſome have ſtretched this word beyond its proper and naturall ſignification; others, and that a multitude, do reſt under the ſhadow of the word, content themſelves in the outward action, do <hi>do it</hi> and no more, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is <hi>not to do it.</hi> For though this word <hi>to doe</hi> be not of ſo large a ſignification as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath drawn it out in, that they might build an Altar, and offer up Chriſt again, which they ſay is to remember him, yet is it not ſo ſcant and narrow as ignorance and prophaneneſſe make it; <hi>verba non ſono, ſed ſenſu ſapiunt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hilary,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hilar. adverſ. Conſt.

This were to reſt in the meanes as in the end, and at once to magnifie and prophane it;
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:59296:258"/> This were to take it as our firſt parents did the Apple, That <hi>our eyes may be opened,</hi> and then to ſee nothing but our own ſhame; this were to eat, and to be damned.</p>
               <p>But this we ſhall not need to inſiſt upon, for it is ſufficient to point out to it, as to a thing to be done, and that we may doe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Authority, and command, and love of the Author, we have all thoſe Motives and inducements which uſe to ſtir us up and incite us unto action, even then when our hands are folded, and we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to move. As, 1. the fitneſſe and applyableneſſe of it to our preſent condition, 2. the profit and advantage it may bring, 3. the pleaſure and delight it carryes along with it, 4. the neceſſity of it, which are as ſo many allurements and invitations, as ſo many winds to drive us on, and make us fly to it as <hi>the Doves to their windows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And 1. it fitteth and complyeth, as it were, with our preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>blanditur noſtrae infirmitati,</hi> and even flatters, and comforts, and rowzeth up our weakneſſe and infirmity; as our Saviour ſpeaks upon another occaſion, This voyce, this inſtitution came for our ſake: we <hi>walk by faith,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.7.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>&amp; hoc eſt noſtrae inſirmitatis,</hi> ſaith the Father, and this is a ſigne and an Argument of humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, that we <hi>walk by faith;</hi> that God can come no neerer to us, nor we to him; that we ſee him onely with that eye, which when it is cleareſt, ſees him but as in a glaſſe, darkly. And therefore as God ſent <hi>Adam</hi> into the world, and gave him <hi>adjutorium ſimile ſibi,</hi> a help convenient and meet for him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. ſo doth he place us in his Church, and affords us many helps meet for us, and attempered to our frailty and humaue Infirmity: He ſpeaks to our Eare, and he ſpeaks to our eye, he ſpeaks in Thunder, and he ſpeaks in a ſtill voyce; he paſſeth his promiſe, and ſeals, and confirmes it; he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to us by his word, and he preaches to us by theſe <hi>Ocular ſermons,</hi> by viſible Elements, by water to purge us, and by Bread and Wine to ſtrengthen us in his grace, and omits nothing that is meet and convenient for us. When God told the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he would no longer goe before them himſelf, he withall tells them, he would ſend his Angel, which ſhould ſead them; and when we are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a neerer approach, he ſends his Angels, his words, his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, his Sacraments, which like thoſe miniſtring ſpirits miniſter for them who are heires of Salvation; and not content with the generall declaration of his mind, he addes unto it certaine ſeals and externall ſignes, that we may even ſee, and handle, and taſte the word of life; and as it was ſaid by <hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> when they made a Covenant, <note place="margin">Gen. 31.48.</note> 
                  <hi>this ſtone ſhall be witneſſe between us:</hi> ſo God doth ſay to thy ſoule by theſe outward Elements, This Covenant have I made with thee, and this that thou ſeeſt, ſhall witneſſe between thee and me. Doe thou look upon it, and bring a bleeding renewed heart
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:59296:258"/> with thee, and then <hi>Doe this,</hi> and I will look upon it as upon the <hi>Raine-bow,</hi> and remember my Covenant, which was made in the bloud of my Sonne: I thus frame and apply my ſelf to thee in things familiar to thy ſight, that thou mayſt draw neerer and neerer to that light, which now thy mortall eye, thy frailty and infirmity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attaine to. And ſhall we not meet and embrace that help which is ſo fitted and proportioned to us?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>profit</hi> is a lure, and calls all men after it, and if you ask with the Apoſtle, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>what profit is there?</hi> we may anſwer with him; <hi>much every manner of way:</hi> For what is profit but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our eſtate, the bettering of our condition? as in the increaſe of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Cattell, the doubling of <hi>Jobs</hi> ſheep, as when <hi>Davids</hi> ſheep-hook was changed into a Scepter, here was improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and advantage: And this we find in our ſpirituall addreſſes, in our reverent acceſſe to this Table, a great improvement, in <hi>ſome thirty,</hi> in <hi>ſome ſixty, in ſome an hundred fold;</hi> a will intended, a love exalted, our hope increaſed, our faith quickened, more earneſtly looking on God, more compaſſionately on our Brethren; more light in our underſtanding, more heat in our affections, more conſtancy in our Patience; every vitious inclination weakned, every vertue root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and eſtabliſht; what is but braſſe it refines into Gold, raiſeth the man, the Earthy man to the participation of a Divine nature. And ſhall we not be covetous of that which is ſo profitable and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Pleaſure is attractiue, is eloquent, and pleads for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance; who will not doe that, which brings ſo much delight and pleaſure when 'tis done? and here in this action of worthy receiving it is, not that ſhort, tranſitory Meteor, the flattery and titillation of the outward man, but that new heaven, which reaſon and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion create in the mind, the joy <hi>of harveſt</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, for here we <hi>reape in joy,</hi> what we <hi>ſow'd in teares;</hi> the joy and triumph of a Conquerour, for here we tread down our enemy under our feet; the joy of a priſoner ſet at liberty, for this is our Jubilee. And ſuch a joy the bloud of Chriſt, if it be taſted and well digeſted, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily bring forth, a pure, refined, ſpirituall, heavenly joy; <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.7.</note> 
                  <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious bloud</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and not to be ſhed for a trifle, for that joy which is no better then madneſſe: and the blood <hi>of an Immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Lamb,</hi> and not to be poured forth for a ſtained, wavering, fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive joy, for a joy as full of pollution, as the world and the fleſh, from whence it ſprung; bring but a true taſte with thee, a ſoule purged from thoſe vitious humors which vitiate and corrupt it, and here is not onely Bread and Wine, but living bread, bread that putteth gladneſſe into the heart, more then Corn and Wine can, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 4. Here is Chriſt, here is joy, here is heaven it ſelf. And
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:59296:259"/> ſhall we not do that, which fills the heart with ſo much joy in the doing it? ſhall we not take and eat that, which is ſo pleaſant to the taſte?</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, it is not onely convenient, pleaſant, and profitable, but it is neceſſary to doe it: for if this Sacrament could have been well ſpared, that men might have well kept the law of the inward man without it; our Lord who came to beat down all the Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the law would not have raiſed up this; but he knew it neceſſary, and therefore left it upon record, as binding as a law, and for ought we find, nay (without all doubt) did never recall or diſpenſe with it. <hi>Do this</hi> is plain, and <hi>do it often</hi> is plain enough, but <hi>do it not,</hi> or <hi>do it ſeldome</hi> is never read; but he calls, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to his table, to feed on the body and blood of Chriſt, and in the ſtrength of it to walk before him and be perfect; that when our ſouls be run to decay, when good habits are weakned, and the graces of God diſcoloured and darkned in us, when our knees are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled, and our hands hang down; when our faculties begin to ſhrink, and be parched, as with the drought of ſummer, we may come to this fountain and fill our ciſternes, and recover our former ſtrength and beauty. Our fault it is and a great one, to be ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring what binds, and what is neceſſary, and if neceſſity drive us not, like dull beaſts we will not mend our pace, and are more led by <hi>Omri</hi>'s ſtatutes, by humane laws, then Chriſts inſtitution; when, if we rightly weigh it, whatſoever is convenient for us, whatſoever may be advantageous to us in the ſervice of our Lord, ſhould be as powerfull with us, as if it came under the imperiall forme of a Law; and what is convenient, and fitted to us in ſuch a caſe, is alſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for us in the ſame condition; neceſſary I ſay, if a more violent neceſſity come not to croſſe and hinder it: for when nothing is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but a will; then a neceſſity lyes upon us, and woe unto us, if we do it not. So now you have them all four; and to conclude this, if theſe will not quicken and move us to come, we are dead in ſin, and have loſt our taſte: Will convenience move us? (we talk much of it) here it is a duty fitted and proportioned to our preſent condition: Will profit move us? and whom doth not profit adde a wing to? lo here it is in this duty, the due performance of which repayes all our coſt and pain with intereſt. Will pleaſure move us? and whom doth not pleaſure tranſport? here is joy, here is paradiſe, here is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and there is none but it. Laſt of all, will neceſſity move us? it is ſaid that will drive us, and if the reſt be but gentle gales, this is as a whirlewind; behold here is neceſſity, a duty as neceſſary as our own wants, and the authority of our High Prieſt and King can make it, who hath not onely commanded us to <hi>do it,</hi> but to <hi>do it often,</hi> which now offers it ſelf to our conſideration.</p>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:59296:259"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>As often as you do it,</hi> implyes a doing it often; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

I will not be ſo bold as to preſcribe how often, nor is it neceſſary to be determined; every mans want and neceſſity in this ſhould be a law unto him, and as oft as he finds his ſoule to droop and faint, here he is to refreſh it; as oft as he feels the inward man to decay, here to repair it; as oft as he ſees the temple of the holy Ghoſt to gather duſt and filth, here to ſweep and purge it; when his faith begins to faile, here to confirm and ſtrengthen it: If we come like rude and unmannerly gueſts, once is too often; but if we purge and cleanſe our hearts, if our ſtomacks be clean, if we come prepared for the feaſt, often we may come, but we cannot come too often. <hi>Sic vive,</hi> ſaith Saint Ambroſe, <hi>ut quotidiè mereare accipere;</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Auguſtin. <hi>ep.</hi> 180.</note> a dayly office and miniſtery. The truth is, the Sacrament is fit for every day, but we are not every day fit for it, and in this different variety of circumſtances of time, and the diſpoſitions and qualifications of men, every man muſt be his own judge and law-giver, and yet the royall law binds him to be fit every day. A great ſhame it is, that any man ſhould be dragg'd to a feaſt; for what a ſtrange law would that ſeem, which ſhould bind a hungry man to eat, or a ſick man to take phyſick, or a dying man to taſte of the water of life? look upon the Primitive Chriſtians (whoſe practice hath bin accounted the beſt interpreter of Scripture) and if thou canſt not with them do it every day, yet let every faire opportunity ſet thy day. Chriſts dead yet all quickning carkaſe is the ſame ſtill, and we ſhould be <hi>Eagles,</hi> as well as they, to fly to it. The Blood of Chriſt is the ſame, his death as full of vertue and efficacy; he is ſtill a fountain of life to them who will taſte him, nor was his moſt precious blood ſhed for the firſt Chriſtians, and in tract and continuance of time dryed up at laſt. At this fountain we may draw as well, and as oft as they, if our pitcher be as fit; and if we loved the cup of bleſſings, we ſhould not fear how oft it came into our hands. But to ſpeak truth, we have degenerated from that <hi>devotion,</hi> that <hi>love,</hi> that <hi>zeale,</hi> which inflamed their breaſts, and retain nothing but the memory of their exceeding piety, which we look upon rather as a pious error, then a juſt and regular devotion; and becauſe we are unfit, and therefore unwilling to do it, perſwade our ſelves, that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition had an early birth, and did follow religion at the heels, to ſupplant it; that by this their buſy, and too frequent remembrance of Chriſt, they did rather flatter then worſhip him, or at beſt, that
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:59296:260"/> they did that, which with more Chriſtian prudence they might have left undone; For if it were devotion then, it could not be loſt in the body and flux of time, which could have no ſuch influence upon it, as to change it ſo, that it ſhould become a ſin in the laſt age, which was thought a duty in the firſt; ſince devotion is like Chriſt himſelf, <hi>yeſterday and to day, and the ſame for ever.</hi> Devotion is ſtill the ſame, but we are not the ſame, but have been bold with her name, and in that name have conjured up thoſe evill ſpirits which blaſt the world, and breathe nothing but profaneneſſe; have ſtarted queſtions, raiſed ſcruples, made new caſes of conſcience, which they, walking in the ſimplicity and integrity of their hearts never heard nor thought of, and ſo did <hi>do it</hi> and <hi>do it often</hi> with leſſe art and noiſe, but with more piety, and with a zeale of a purer flame, and a heat more innocent; their devotion was to do it often, ours is to talk and magnifie it, and to do it when we pleaſe. The duty it ſelf of celebration how oft hath it been neglected, and ſet at deriſion in this latter age? what tragedyes raiſed about a name? what co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies? what ſcoffs and jeſts upon the holy action? what groſſe and impious partiality in admitting men unto it? how have we diſtinguiſht and made a ſtrange difference of one from another, and counted none fit, but of ſuch a part, or ſuch a faction? when were we not too far engaged in the world, and did not the world too far engage and bind us to ſuch a ſide or faction, we could not but ſee, that the very being of a ſide or faction, the dividing our ſelves from our brethren, for things no whit eſſentiall to Chriſtianity, hath force enough, not onely to drive us from this table, but to ſhut us out of heaven. For what ſhould ſuch uncharitable men do at a feaſt of love? what ſhould ſuch carnall men (the Apoſtle calls them ſo) feed on this ſpirituall food? I will not ſtand to confute theſe groundleſſe and ridiculous, but dangerous and deſtructive fancies (for theſe men have more need of our teares and prayers, then our confutation) I had rather remove thoſe hindrances and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardances, thoſe pretences, and excuſes, which men not well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in piety, uſe to frame and lay in their own way, and ſo fearing a fall and bruiſe at that, which no hand could ſet up againſt them but their own, make not their approches ſo oft as they ſhould to this holy table.

               <p>And the firſt and great pretenſe is; our own weakneſſe and unworthineſſe, which is the iſſue of our own will, begot in us by the ſenſe of ſome habit of ſin, which we have diſcovered reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill in our mortall bodies; at the ſight of which we ſtart back, even from that which might help us, and cannot compoſe and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify our ſelves for the celebration; Before the action they are afraid, even afraid of the feaſt, afraid of life; at the table, they
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:59296:260"/> have a ſad and caſt down countenance drawn out more by a diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed troubled mind, then that reverentiall joy which it ſhewes forth in the outward man, when it is at reſt, and we go away from it, with the ſame burden we brought to it, which we would and would not lay down; are weary, but ſeek not eaſe, but from thoſe averſions which make it heavier then it was, and then we feel it again, and ſo are ever preparing and never prepared to come to this feaſt. For our preparation is our mortifying of our ſinfull luſts, which is not done, whileſt any one ſin hath this power and dominion in us: For how can he come to this fountain of life, who is unwilling to live? how can he partake of Chriſts blood, who yet loves that ſin, for the waſhing away of which Chriſt ſhed it? ſo that he ſinnes if he come, and he ſinnes if he come not; a miſerable dilemma that ſinne drives him upon, that like the ſervant in the comedy, <hi>ſi faxit perit, ſi non faxit vapulat,</hi> if he do it, he eats his own damnation, and ſhall never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe be puniſht if he do it not.</p>
               <p>For not onely acts, but omiſſions are evil; It is a ſinne to kill my father, and it is a ſin not to help him: it is a ſin to oppreſſe, and it is a ſin not to give an almes: It is a ſin to reſiſt a ſuperiour, and 'tis a ſin not to honor him. It is a ſin to contemn the ſacrament, and 'tis a ſin not to receive it; and the one leads to the other, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or indifferency to open profaneneſſe; the ſinnes of omiſſion to ſinnes of commiſſion; he that doth not what he ſhould, hath made a bridge for his luſts, which will ſoon carry him over to do what he ſhould not. He that will not help his parents, will be drawn on by the leaſt temptation to diſhonor them; he that will not feed the poore, will be ſoon induced to grind their face; he that will not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor the king, when opportunity favours him, will pull him from his throne; he that neglects the ſacrament, or is indifferent, within a while may be ready to take it away, as a thing of no uſe at all; ſin conſiſts as well in the negation, or non-performance of that we are bound to, as in the doing of ſome act; which is contrary to it, in which commonly it ends at laſt: nor is it then onely, when the will is directly carried to the omiſſion it ſelf, when I will not do it, becauſe I will not do it, which is high contempt; but when the will ſettles and reſts upon that by which I am hindred from doing that which I am bound to do, and which I would willingly, and might eaſily do, but for this obſtacle, which I my ſelf ſet up againſt my ſelf; but for that ſin which is the iſſue of my luſt, and which I had rather cleave to, then to the command of Chriſt; ſo that now I do not abſtain from the Lords table upon neceſſity, but volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, nor can I ſay, <hi>I would receive,</hi> when I thus ſay within my ſelf, I <hi>will yet ſin;</hi> for he that will not prepare himſelf, will not ſit down at his table: but we may heare ſometimes large expreſſions of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from thoſe who are ſo backward in this duty, and troubled they
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:59296:261"/> are, that they are ſuch, but not fit for a Phyſician; that they are hungry, but have no ſtomack to that which ſhould feed and nouriſh them; that they love the feaſt, but are not yet prepared to eat. <hi>I am ſorry,</hi> is ſoone ſaid, even by them, who yet take pleaſure, reap pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and advantage from that ſin which they bewayle; who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne it by theſe mournfull and ſad declarations of their mind, and yet give it the higheſt place in their heart: <hi>I am ſorry,</hi> is too often a lye, but if it be not a lye, it is, and will be accepted as our preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>for godly ſorrow brings forth repentance not to be repented of,</hi> and every prenitent is a fit communicant: He that hath mingled his teares with his Saviours blood, is a welcome gueſt at this table.</p>
               <p>What then is to be done in this caſe, when the conſcience of ſome habit of ſin keepeth us from coming? for certainly a great ſin it muſt needs be, to make one ſin an apology for another, to excuſe a ſin of omiſſion, by a ſin of commiſſion, and when I will not do that whſch I ſhould, to put in that plea, that I have done what I ſhould not.</p>
               <p>This knot then like the Gordian knot muſt be cut aſunder with the ſword, with the ſword of the ſpirit; This habit of ſinne muſt be ſhaken off, and we muſt uſe a violence upon our ſelves, ſtrive and labour with earneſtneſſe, and by practſing that which is contrary to it, to be leſſe and leſſe fetter'd and entangled every day: For to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in it cannot be infirmity or weakneſſe (for that name we give even to malice it ſelf) but obſtinacy, and a pleaſing and wilfull perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in ſinne. Why wilt thou not come? or rather, why wilt thou ſtill ſinne? for what wert thou made a Chriſtian? for what did the grace of God appeare? for what did his moſt precious blood guſh out of his ſides, but to purge and cleanſe thee from thy ſinne? why doeſt thou love thy diſeaſe? why doeſt thou favour thy fleſh and corruption? why doeſt thou envenom and feſter thy ſore? why art thou ſuch a <hi>Judas,</hi> firſt to betray thy Saviour, and then hang thy ſelf? why doeſt thou ſtill ſtand out and wilt not be cured? why doeſt thou preferr thy ſin before the ſacrament, thy husks, before the Bread of Life? why art thou ſick, and wilt be ſick, dying, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveſt to dye? thou wilt not come becauſe thou haſt ſinned; break of thy ſin and come: if thou condemneſt thy ſelf, why doeſt thou not forſake thy ſelf? doeſt thou acknowledge what thou art, and yet continue what thou art? thou who wilt ſtrike that man to the ground who ſtands in thy way to honor or wealth, haſt not heart enough to deſtroy that ſin, which thou ſayſt doth obſtruct thy paſſage, and keep thee from this feaſt, from the table of the Lord, which was ſpread on purpoſe, that thou ſhouldſt firſt demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and remove thy ſin, and then come and eat:</p>
               <pb n="403" facs="tcp:59296:261"/>
               <p>This then is but a hindrance, a block of offence of our own hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, an evil ſpirit which we invited to us, and we muſt caſt it out. Tell me, canſt thou believe? why, then thou mayſt come; if this faith be ſtrong enough to caſt down thoſe imaginations, which ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up againſt Chriſt, to work in thee holy ceſires, and holy reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions: and art thou now in an <hi>agonie</hi> in this bleſſed contention with thy ſelf? art thou ſerious in the reſiſtance of this thy enemy? and doſt thou gain ſome conqueſt over him every day? then thou maiſt come, though thou art not yet made perfect.</p>
               <p>For we muſt remember (that the weaker Chriſtian lye not down under his burden, not able to move towards the cup of Bleſſings, when it is reacht forth unto him) we muſt remember, I ſay, that Faith and true ſanctifying Grace have a wide latitude, that they are not ſo quick and active in one man as in another, and yet may ſave both. There be, who by continuall watching over themſelves, by continuall ſtruggling with themſelves, by a vehement and inceſſant preſſing forward, are wel neer come unto the mark, that have ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed themſelves in the profeſſion and exerciſe of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that they run their race with ioy, and are ſcarce ſenſible of a tentation; who have made holineſſe ſo familiar to them, that no wile or enterprize of Satan can divorce them. In a word, who by <hi>that ſeed which is in them, keep themſelves that he wicked one toucheth them not,</hi> as S. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks. Theſe have no Oxen, nor Farmes; <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.7. and 5.18.</note> Theſe are not married to the world, and therefore they will come.</p>
               <p>Again, there be ſome who are but as it were <hi>Incipients</hi> in the ſchool of Chriſt, and in their way, but labouring and panting forward, and are as it were <hi>in fieri,</hi> in the making, framing and compoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by that royall law which the Church of Chriſt holds forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; who though they have for ſome time ſuckt the breaſts of the Church, and received the ſincere milk of the Word, yet are not yet grown thereby into perfect men in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> have not yet that ſtrength to deſtroy the whole body of ſin, but fall ſometimes into this ſin, ſometimes into that; but thoſe they fall into are not ſo many, nor ſo manifeſt, not ſo offenſive and hurtfull to others, not of that number or bulk, as to ſhut them out of the Church, or to exclude them from the communion of Saints. Theſe have not yet <hi>attained,</hi> but they follow after; and though they have an eye toward the world, yet they come to Chriſts Table with a firm reſolution to pluck it out; and though their right hand offends them, yet they will cut it off, and with all their ſtrength, and with all their ſoul ſhake off the yoke of ſinne, and take Chriſts upon them, and even now are they hot and intentive on that work. Theſe men, I ſay, may, nay ought to come, and here quicken their Faith, improve their Charity, ſtrengthen and fix their Reſolutions; and they who are ſo ſevere and
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:59296:262"/> over-rigid as to drive them from it, do ſhut themſelves out, though not from the table, yet from the feaſt, and are more unfit then they, becauſe they want that charity which is required of a gueſt, even that charity which will not <hi>bruiſe the broken reed, nor quench the ſmoaking flaxe.</hi> It was a pious wiſh of Moſes <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. <hi>would God all the Lords people were Prophets;</hi> and it were as much piety to wiſh, <hi>and with his ſpirit, would all Chriſtians were perfect,</hi> that every one were as Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and knew nothing by himſelf. But we are <hi>in via,</hi> and as travellours on the way, one man makes more haſt then another, walks with more eaſe and delight, ſlips not, falls not ſo often; another walks after, though not with the ſame ſpeed and cheerfulneſſe, becauſe he meets with rubs and difficulties, which he every day contends with, and both at laſt by the guidance of the ſame ſpirit, and by the power of a compaſſionate Saviour, come to their journeys end; and he that goes before, and he that comes more faintly and ſlowly after, meet at laſt and ſit down together in the ſame heaven. And now, in ſuch variety of tempers, ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of temptations, amongſt ſo many errors which ſome men quit themſelves of with leſſe, ſome with more trouble, we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud thoſe who are neer the top of perfection, but we muſt not deſpiſe thoſe who are in their aſcent, and labouring and ſtriving for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward after them; not quench the ſpirit in any man, though it burn not ſo brightly in ſome as it doth in others who are more fully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned; not ſhut them out as unclean beaſts, becauſe they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſomething of the frailty of man; even ſuch as theſe ('tis plain) Saint <hi>Paul</hi> admitted in this chapter, and he pleads for them <hi>Galat.</hi> vi.i. as for thoſe <hi>who are to be reſtored with the ſpirit of meekneſſe,</hi> and we cannot ſhut them out from his table or preſence, whom Chriſt is ſo willing to meet, <hi>when being weary and heavy laden they come unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor doth this admitting weaker Chriſtians open a door to let in wilfull offenders, nor a gap to let in the goates to feed in the ſame green paſtures with the ſheep. Theſe Beaſts, if they come too neere, will be thruſt through with a dart: But then all ſinnes are not of the ſame malignity, and we muſt put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Judas's</hi> fall and <hi>Peter's.</hi> All ſinnes do not ſtrike us out of the covenant, and therefore do not drive us from Chriſts table, where we are to renew and confirm it: there be ſome ſinnes which are <hi>devoratoria ſalutis,</hi> and ſwallow up all hope of ſalvation, whileſt they remain in us; there be <hi>peccata fortia, Amos</hi> 5.12. boiſterous and <hi>mighty ſinnes,</hi> which do urge the Juſtice of God, and even weary and conquer his clemency; there be others which weaker Chriſtians through frailty fall into even in the ſtate of grace, and which God will not be extreame to puniſh, though in Juſtice he might, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines a <hi>Father</hi> ſtill of thoſe who ſeriouſly endeavour, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:59296:262"/> times faile for his covenant ſake which he made in his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, and of theſe ſinnes Saint <hi>John</hi> ſpeakes 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. <hi>If we ſinne, we have an advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is a propitiation four our ſinnes.</hi> In a word, if all that ſinne were excluded, the feaſt were at an end; and if ſome that ſinne were not excluded, the table were no more a table, but an Altar for Theeves and murderers to fly to.</p>
               <p>Feare then of infirmity is no excuſe, but we ſhould ſhake it off with our ſinne; it is an evil ſpirit of our own rayſing, and we muſt conjure it down: But there is another pretenſe, and it is drawn from a high conceit of the Sacrament, and an apprehenſion of an exceſſive and angelicall kind of perfection, which ſome conceive is neceſſary to the due celebration of it; and ſo they are going towards it, but make no ſpeed; are in action, but do nothing; are coming but never come, This may ſeeme to be great humility, but as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Iſta Humilitas tollit humilitatem,</hi> this humility puts true humility from its office; for it is ſhe alone that takes us by the hand, and leads us to this ſupper; <hi>Dicendo ſe indignum fecit ſe dignum,</hi> ſaith the ſame Father of the Centurion in the Goſpel; if we can truly ſay we are unworthy, we make our ſelves worthy, and thus we ſet forward towards it. But groundleſſe ſcrupuloſity, which many times is rather the iſſue of pride, then the daughter of humility, ſees the way, and then ſits down in it, and then makes every pibble a mountain, puzzles and perplexes us, ſets us a framing and faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dangers to our ſelves, and inconveniences, and ſumming them up, like the man in <hi>Lucian,</hi> who ſat on the Sea ſhore numbring each wave as it came towards him, till at laſt the waves driving one another, beat on and wrought themſelves over his head, and drown'd him. In a word, it weakens and diſenables us in the performance of our duty, and with it we are ſo good, that, as the <hi>Italian</hi> proverb is, we are good for nothing.</p>
               <p>This is but a ſcruple iudeed, and it weighs no more, and the leaſt breath is ſtrong enough to blow it away. For upon the ſame inducement we muſt ſeale up our lips and never pray, we muſt ſtay at home and not go to Church; for <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; what mortall is fir for theſe things? how can duſt and aſhes ſpeak to the majeſty of heaven? what eare is purged enough to hear his word? whoſe feet are clean enough to tread his courts? And why do we pretend weakneſſe or unworthineſſe? are we too weak, are we too unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to do his will? or can Chriſt command us that, which our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe will make a ſin for us to do? when the trumpet hath ſounded, when the law is promulged, this fear muſt vaniſh: when our Saviour hath once ſpoken it, <hi>take, eat, this is my Body,</hi> ſhall we neglect to do it, and make this our plea, that we are not worthy to
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:59296:263"/> do it? when he would cleanſe and purge us, ſhall we cry we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy? unfit to do his will, but not unfit to break it? unfit to be redeemed, but not unfit to periſh? unfit to empty our ſelves of our pollution, but not unfit to ſettle on our lees? Oh 'tis ill thus to apologize, and diſpute, and fret our ſelves to deſtruction, to lye ſick and bed-rid in ſin, and ſay we are unfit and unworthy to be healed: And what Reverence is that to Chriſt, which crucifies him again, and tramples his blood under our feet? for not to receive it, not to be purged and better'd by it, I am ſure, is in the higheſt degree to diſhonor it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall inſiſt the longer upon this, for I ſee too many withdraw and put from them this favour and grace of God, and call it reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and might well bluſh at this their apology, if they did rightly conſider what reverence is. Now reverence is nothing elſe but a kind of Juſtice paying back that which is due to a benefit, for ſome good it hath, or may bring unto us, and is either our overball or our reall gratitude. <hi>Thou ſhalt reverence my Sanctuary, Levit.</hi> 19.30. for here we offer up our ſelves to God, and God deſcends in bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings upon us. The word of the Lord is reverend, for it is the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God unto ſalvation; <hi>therefore I eſteemed</hi> all thy precepts, ſaith <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 119.128. <hi>and holy and reverend is his name,</hi> for whatſoever good we do, we do in his name. And yet ſee, If we take not heed, if we keep not our feet, we may bow in his temple, and offer up the ſacrifice of fooles; we may greedily harken what God will ſay, and yet deſpiſe his word; we may call upon his Name, do wonders in his Name, and yet blaſpheme it; as the <hi>Jewes</hi> bowed before Chriſt when they mockt him, and ſpet upon him, and ſmote him on the head. No: reverence is the payment, of a debt, and what is due to the Sanctuary? even that we ſhould lift up holy hands; what do we owe unto his word? even obedience; and what reverence is due to the Sacrament? in Scripture we read of none <hi>in terminis,</hi> for there need no command to bind us to honor it; for who will not reverence that love which is breathed forth from Majeſty? who doth not reverence the meaneſt gift that comes from the hands of a King? but what reverence is that that refuſeth it? or is he reverent, who, when he is invited to a royall feaſt, will not come? what reverence is that that leaves Chriſts body, as it were, hanging on the Croſſe, and his blood poured out on the ground, and will not ſtoop to take it up? If we look upon it well we ſhall find that excuſe hath not a more ugly face in any defect, which it is brought in no countenance, then in this. For tell me, why ſhould we not be afraid to heare the word? why have we ſuch itching eares? why do we throng and preſſe into his courts? is there not as great a preparation due unto that? is it ſo eaſie a matter to fling off all our unruly affections? are we ſo ſoone
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:59296:263"/> made fit to ſpeak unto God, that he may heare; or to heare, when he doth ſpeak; or may we as ſoone do it, <hi>as pull off our ſhooes from our feet,</hi> and make good the thing it ſelf, as we can the repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? indeed we make it our apology, but it is foule ingratitute, and we cannot call it by a worſe name, for it takes in all, our negligence, our luke-warmneſſe, our imprudency, our carnality, our love of thoſe evils which firſt trouble us, and then make us loath our peace, firſt make us ſick, and then afraid of the phyſician. This excuſe, I I am ſure, is not put up by thoſe whom Chriſt bids depart into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire; for they do not ſay, we were unworthy to <hi>feed,</hi> or <hi>cloth,</hi> or <hi>viſit</hi> thee, but we never ſaw thee <hi>hungry,</hi> or <hi>naked,</hi> or in <hi>priſon:</hi> they did not think that Chriſt had been ſhut in priſon with <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> or that he had begged in <hi>Lazarus.</hi> If heaven ſhould open it ſelf to receive thee, wouldeſt thou ſtay below with ſinne and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and cry, thou art unworthy to ſtrive to enter it? behold here in the Sacrament, Paradiſe is, as it were, again laid open to thee, and no cherubin ſtands againſt thee, and ſhall this weak pretence of a willfull ſinner be as a flaming ſword to keep thee from the tree of life? ſay then to theſe pretences, as thou ſhouldeſt to <hi>Satan,</hi> who is the forget of them, <hi>avoid, get you behind me:</hi> for this is a command laid upon all Chriſtians, and ſnppoſes all able to receive it, and no man is infirme, or weak, or unworthy, but he that makes himſelf ſo; <hi>for his commandments are not grievous,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>John,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them all, there is not one leſſe grievous then this. For is it not eaſier to do this, then to deny our ſelves, to take up the Croſſe, to love our enemies, to lay down our lives for the brethren? and yet under this heavy obligation we lye. Whether we make it good or no, I know not, but whether it be done or not, no man, I think, did ever put up this pretence, that he was unworthy to do it; and ſhall we even offer our ſelves to the hardeſt task, to the weightier matters of the Goſpel, and ſtartle and fly back and be afraid of the Sacrament? are we fit to receive his commands, which exact our goods, and our life, and ſhall there be a time when we ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to receive the pledges of his love? are we worthy to be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and not worthy to be communicants?</p>
               <p>I do not here forbid preparation, for 'tis that I urge and preſſe, but unworthineſſe is the worſt excuſe, becauſe we are bound to caſt it off; and we cannot more diſhonor the Sacrament, then by not receiving it. For from what root but from that of bitterneſſe doth this evil weed, doth this banefull pretence ſpring us? Let us take an Inventory of all thoſe things which occaſion it, and we ſhall find them all to be ſuch fruit of which we may well be aſhamed; the beſt of them is our calling and neceſſary imployments in the world; and is the world which paſſeth away of ſuch value with us, that we will not leave it behind us, for a while to meet with Chriſt at his
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:59296:264"/> table? is our daily bread ſweeter to us then the bread of Life? is <hi>mammon</hi> a greater God then God himſelf? but then the reſt are of that nature that we ſhould be afraid to think of them; luke-warmneſſe in religion, love of our ſinnes, unwillingneſſe to part with them, or to be ſaved too ſoone, theſe are the rotten bones which lye under this painted Sepulchre and glorious pretenſe of great reverence to the Sacrament: Our farme, our oxe, our wife, our vanity, our ſin is preferred before Chriſt, and then we ſay we reverence him.</p>
               <p>But now, take this pretenſe of reverence with the beſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation you can give it; ſuppoſe they that pretend it are not men devoted to the world, and vanity, but ſuch as do try and examine themſelves every day, and keep a carefull watch over their hearts, (and yet it is ſcarce probable ſuch men ſhould pretend unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for theſe tares of excuſes commonly grow upon the rocks, and barrenneſſe, and not upon good ground) but ſuppoſe this high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence they have of the Sacrament, may keep them off, and make them afraid to come neere; yet as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes in another caſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. This is utterly a fault in them, if not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

                  </gap> it is not ſo bad as profaneneſſe, but a fault it is, and neglect too large for this excuſe to palliate and cover.</p>
               <p>For 1. By this their abſtaining they do either pity or condemn thoſe that are more forward, as thoſe that venture too far upon that <hi>formidable myſtery,</hi> which they look upon at diſtance, and tremble, and dare not come neere; as thoſe that do not well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what they do, and therefore are bold to do it; as men whom not conſcience but preſumption brings to the Altar. They will ſay perhaps, they paſſe no ſuch cenſure on their brethren, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them not; but yet they may, and ſpeak not a word, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them by their actions, as <hi>Noah</hi> did condemn the world by his faith; for when in our behaviour we turn our back upon them, there is ſomething of a ſharpe reprehenſion flyes from us, like an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from a Parthians bow, after thoſe who walk another way. And this <hi>utterly is a fault</hi> by my not eating to condemn them that eat: This is <hi>contriſtari fratres,</hi> this is to grieve our brethren, to make them think that <hi>mors in olla,</hi> that death is in the pot, danger in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bread of life: this is to walk uncharitably, and for ought we know, to deſtroy him with our not eating, for whom Chriſt dyed.</p>

<pb n="409" facs="tcp:59296:264"/> neere to the mount? If men of more reſerved converſation, who keep themſelves unſpotted of the world, tremble and dare not come nigh, how may many weak Chriſtians, who hope here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their additionall ſtrength, be ſtruck with terror, and ſo refuſe to come? and think of theſe myſteries as the <hi>Germans</hi> in <hi>Tacitus</hi> did of thoſe offices which they performed to their Goddeſſe <hi>Hertha,</hi> the earth?

               <p>I know we cannot give too much reverence unto it, we cannot give enough; but that ſervant doth but little honour his maſter, who will bow, and cringe, and kiſſe his hand, and keep at diſtance, and yet ſleep in his ſervice. Obedience and reverence are twins, they are borne, and grow up, and dye together: I am not truly reverent till my obedience ſpeaks and publiſheth it, and if I obey not, my reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is but a name, and it profiteth nothing; as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake in another caſe, <hi>If be a breaker of the law, my Circumciſion is made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion:</hi> If I doe not come as Chriſt commands, I may call it reverence, but he will count it a great diſhonour to his love.</p>
               <p>We complaine much of the ſuperſtition of the Romiſh party, we are angry with their Altars, their veſtments, their bowings, and cringes, and count it a kind of Theatricall Idolatry, and I think, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breach of Charity we may; for as they make it, it is one of the greateſt Idols in the world; but we muſt take heed how we cry down ſuperſtition in others, whilſt we ſuffer it to lye at our own doores; how we condemn it as a monſter, as it walks abroad, when we hug and cheriſh it in our own breaſts. <note place="margin">Superſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> For what is ſuperſtition but a groundleſſe feare? what is it but a feare where no feare is, or if there be, a feare which we are bound to aboliſh?

               <p>I have dwelt the longer on this ſubject, becauſe I ſee this duty ſo much neglected; ſome not fit to come, others not ſo much unfit, as unwilling; ſome ſo ſpirituall, or rather ſo carnall and profane, that they contemn it; ſome ſo careleſs, that they ſeldome think ont, but ſuffer their ſoule to run to ruine, not to be raiſs'd and repaired

Not come, becauſe I <hi>care not?</hi> not come, becauſe I <hi>will not?</hi> not come becauſe I <hi>dare not?</hi> not come? That utterly is a fault, and neglect doth aggrandize it; contempt doth make it yet greater; and infirmity, and conceit of our unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe is another fault, and our high eſteeme of the Ceremony cannot wipe it out, but it ſhewes it ſelf even through this reverence, and ſhewes us guilty of the Body and bloud of Chriſt, though we eat not this Bread, nor drink this cup; we pretend indeed we cannot, but the truth is, we will not come. Let us not then bring in our unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe as an excuſe, for ſuch an Apology is our doome which we paſſe againſt our ſelves, which removes, and ſets us a farre off from any relief of that mercy which ſhould ſeale our pardon, becauſe we ſay we need it not: <hi>we ought not to doe, what we ought to doe,</hi> and we <hi>are unworthy to doe our duty,</hi> is brought in as an excuſe, but it is our condemnation. Let us then <hi>doe it,</hi> and let us <hi>doe it often,</hi> and in the laſt place let us doe it to that end for which he did firſt inſtitute, and ordaine it.

               </p>
               <p>And now we may imagine that this is a thing ſoon done, a matter of quick diſpatch; for as the Jewes had <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo have we Chriſt read in our Churches every Sabbath day; he is the ſtory, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the times, and we name him almoſt as often as we ſpeak, and too often name him, but not with that reverence which we ſhould; but thus to remember him may be a greater injury then forgetfulneſſe, and better we never knew him, then thus to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him. And therefore we muſt remember, that this remembrance conſiſts not in a bare calling back into our mind every paſſage of his glorious Oeconomy, by bringing him from his cratch to his croſſe, and from his croſſe to his grave; for words of knowledge in ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture evermore imply the affections; when <hi>Joſeph</hi> deſired <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Butler to <hi>remember him,</hi> his meaning was he ſhould procure his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: when <hi>Nehemiah</hi> prayes to God to <hi>remember him</hi> in his laſt Chap. v. 22. he interprets himſelf, and <hi>pardon me according to the multitude of thy mercies:</hi> when the Thief on the Croſſe beſpeaks Chriſt to <hi>remember him when he came into his kingdome,</hi> he then beg'd a kingdome. Indeed ſuch a benefit deſerves to be had in everlaſting remembrance; for what is a jewell of a rich price in the hands of a foole, who hath no heart to receive and keep it? what were all the glory of the Starres, of the Sun and the Moon, which he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, if there were no eye to behold them? How can ſeed be quickned, if the womb of the earth receive it not? or what a pearl is the Goſpel, if the heart be not the Cabinet? what is Chriſt, if he be not remembred?</p>
               <pb n="411" facs="tcp:59296:265"/>
               <p>We muſt then, and upon this occaſion eſpecially, open the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter of our ſoul, and enroll Chriſt there in deep and living chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters; For the memory is a preſerver of that which ſhe receives: but then it is not enough for us to behold theſe glorious Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſmes, and carry them about with us as pretious Antidotes, unleſſe we bring them <hi>ab inteſtino memoriae ad os cogitationis,</hi> as Saint <hi>Auſt.</hi> ſpeaks, from the inward part of the memory to the mouth and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack of the cogitative faculty, which is our ſpirituall rumination, <note place="margin">Auguſt. cont.

                  </gap>, we learn and are inſtructed by thoſe notions, which were formerly imprinted in our Memory; we do conceive and are in travell, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, with Chriſt; till he be fully formed in us; we work him out <hi>in Cogitatoria,</hi> in the Elaboratory of our hearts. When we have him in our thoughts, and his precepts alwaies before our eyes, as in a book which checkes us at every turn, and by a frequent Contemplation of them draw our ſoules out of thoſe encumbrances which many times involve and fetter them; when we recollect our mind into it ſelf, and faſten it to this rock, where it may reſt as upon a holy hill, from whence it may look down and behold every object in its proper ſhape; look upon an injury as a benefit, perſecution as a bleſſing, and ſee life in the face and countenance of death, then and not till then we may be ſaid to remember him. For can he remember a meek Chriſt, who will be angry without a cauſe? can he remember a poore Chriſt, that makes <hi>Mammon</hi> his God? can he remember the Prince of Peace, who is wholly bent to war? can he remember Chriſt, who is as ready to betray him as <hi>Judas,</hi> and naile him to the Croſſe as <hi>Pilat?</hi> Better he were quite raced out of our memory, then that we ſhould thus ſet him there as a mark to be ſhot at; then to be thus ſet up, to be ſcorned, and reviled, and ſpit upon, and Crucified again; better never to have known him, then to know, and put him to ſhame. And therefore, if we will remember him, we muſt contemplate him in his own ſphere, in that ſite and aſpect which he looks upon us; <hi>deliberare, &amp; cauſas expendere,</hi> well weigh and conſider upon what termes and conditions we did firſt receive him, and entertain him in our thoughts and memories, and this will drive Chriſtianity home, make it enter into the ſoule and ſpirit,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:59296:266"/> faſten and rivet Chriſt into us, and make him a part of us; that his promiſes and precepts, and the virtue of his death and paſſion may be in our memory as veſſels are in a well-ordered family, whence upon every occaſion we may readily take them out for our uſe, find a defence againſt every temptation, a buckler for evey dart, that ſo the love of Chriſt may ſwallow up all reluctancy in us, in victory. This gives us a true taſte and reliſh of the ſweetneſſe of thoſe bleſſings and benefits which we receive in the Sacrament. For the ſweetneſſe of honey, ſaith <hi>Baſil,</hi> is not known ſo well by the Philoſophers diſcourſe, as by the taſte (which is a better and ſurer judge then the moſt ſubtile Naturaliſts) no more are the benefits of Chriſt and his Goſpel, though uttered by the Tongue of men and Angels, in the words which conveigh them, as in a heart melted and transformed into the Love of Chriſt; then in the mind of man, when it is the ſame mind which is in Chriſt Jeſus: there he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred indeed, there he is placed not as in the High Prieſts Hall, to be mockt, and derided, and blaſphemed, but as in his throne, in his heaven, where he diſpenſeth his light, his joy, his glory, ſuch glory as no Eloquence is equall to, no language can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, not Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, who was caught up into Paradiſe and taſted the ſweetneſſe of it, and then tells us no more then this, that they were <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

                  </gap> the words were unſpeakable words, words which it was <hi>not poſsible for a man to utter;</hi> which was in effect, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.4.</note> to tell us he did feele it, but could not tell us what it was: and thus to taſte him is <hi>to remember him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And firſt, It takes in our faith, I do not meane a dead and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active faith, for that leaves us dead and buried in a land of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion, never looking upon Chriſt, or his benefits, nor gathering any ſtrength or virtue from him, and no more conſidering this our High Prieſt, then if he had never offered himſelf, never ſatisfied, never been but a faith that worketh by love, a faith that followes Chriſt; through every Period, and ſtage, and paſſage of his bleſſed oeconomy; a faith that is a diſciple, and followes him whitherſoever he goes; looks upon him in time of proſperity, and cloths him in the dayes of affliction, forgets them, remembring him; in injuries, and forgives them; in death it ſelf, and makes him our Reſurrection, makes us one with him, that we cannot think, or ſpeak, or move, that we cannot live, nor dye without him.</p>
               <p>Now the time of receiving the Sacrament, of the receiving theſe pledges of his love, and theſe <hi>pignora fidei,</hi> theſe pledges of our faith, is the time of actuating, of quickning and increaſing our faith, that it may be more apprehenſive, more operative, more lively, that it may even ſpring in our hearts at the mention of Chriſt, at this repreſentation of his body and blood, as the babe did in <hi>Elizabeths</hi>
                  <pb n="413" facs="tcp:59296:266"/> womb at the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>'s ſalutation. For our Faith, as it may have its increaſings and improvements, ſo it may have its decreaſings and failings; may be weakned by the daily incurſions which the world and the devil make upon it, by preſenting objects of Terror to daunt and enfeeble it, objects of delight to ſlumber and charm it. It may be weakned by the daily avocations and common actions of our life, that we may not cleave ſo cloſe unto Chriſt, not eye him with that intention, not love him with that fervour, not obey him with that cheerfulneſſe which we ſhould, but be in a diſpoſition ready to fall off, and let go our hold of him. And therefore as we muſt at all times ſtir it up, and actuate it, ſo eſpecially in our approaches to the Lords table, for in this doth our preparation to it, in this doth the benefit and power of the Sacrament principally conſiſt: for here doth our Saviour, as it were, again preſent himſelf to us, opens him wounds, ſhewes us his hand, and his ſide, ſpeaks to us as he did to <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> reach hither your fingers and behold my hands; and reach hither your hands and thruſt them into my ſides; <hi>take, eat, this is my body,</hi> and be not faithleſſe but believing; here ſhake off that chilneſs, that reſtiveneſſe, that acedie, that wearineſſe, that faintneſſe of your faith; here warm, and actuate, and quicken it, that it may be a working, fighting, conquering faith. For thus to do it is to <hi>do this in remembrance of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It takes in repentance, by which we doe moſt truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Chriſt; remember his birth, and are born againe, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is our new birth; remember his Circumciſion, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe our hearts, for repentance is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the great circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, ſaith <hi>Epiphanius;</hi> goe about with him doing good, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is our obedience; remember him on his <hi>Croſſe,</hi> for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſetteth up a Croſſe in imitation of his, and lifts us up upon it, ſtretcheth and dilates all the powers of our ſoule, peirceth our hearts, and ſo crucifies the fleſh, and the affections and luſts thereof. Our repentance, if it be true, is an imitation of Chriſts ſuffering, a revenge upon our ſelves for what the Jewes did to him; the proper iſſue and effect to his love; for what Chriſt worketh in us, he firſt works upon us, makes us ſee, and feele, and handle his love, that we may be active in thoſe duties of love, which by his command and enſample we owe to him, and in him to our brethren: He dyed to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our ſinnes, that is, that he might make ſinne to ceaſe, for ſo the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> implyes; gives us ſtrength by repentance quite to extinguiſh and aboliſh ſinne. Thus if we repent, thus if we doe, we doe it in <hi>remembrance of him.</hi> And this we are to doe, but then eſpecially when we prepare our ſelves, and make our addreſſes to Chriſts Table; for though repentance be the fruit of a due exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of our ſelves, yet we may and muſt examine our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it ſelf, and the time to doe it is now, now thou art to renew
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:59296:267"/> thy Covenant, and ſo muſt alſo renew thy repentance. In the Feaſt of the Atonement the Lord tells his people, Lev. 23.27. <hi>you ſhall keep it, and he that doth not afflict his ſoul, ſhall be cut off,</hi> This is a day for it, and in this day thou muſt doe it. This is the ſeaſon to ranſack thy ſoule, to ſee how many graines of hypocriſie were left behind in thy former repentance, what hollowneſs was in thy groanes, what coldneſſe in thy devotion; to ſee what advantage Satan hath ſince taken, what ground he hath won in thy ſoule; and then in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſts love ſet afreſh to the work of mortification, wound thy heart deeper, lay on ſurer blowes, empty thy ſelf of thy ſelf, of all that ruſt and rubbiſh which thy ſelf-love left behind, and then ſtir up thoſe graces in thee which through inadvertency and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſſe lye raked up as in the aſhes; in a word, refine every ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, quicken every grace, intend thy will, exalt thy faith, draw neerer to Chriſt, and ſo renew thy Covenant, and ſit down at his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and thus if thou <hi>doe it,</hi> thou <hi>doſt it in remembrance of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might here take in the whole traine, the whole Circle and Crown of Chriſtian graces and virtues, and draw them together and ſhut them within the compaſſe of this one word <hi>remembrance,</hi> for it will comprehend them all; knowledge, obedience, love, ſincerity, thankfulneſſe, from whence the Sacrament hath its name, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>my laſt payment, and peace offering;</hi> for he that truly believes and repents, as he is ſick of ſinne, ſo is he ſick of love, of that love, which in the Sacrament is ſealed, and confirmed to us; is full of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge, is ever bowing to Chriſts ſcepter, is ſincere and like himſelf in all his wayes, will meditate of it day and night, will drive it <hi>ab animo in habitum,</hi> as <hi>Tertull.</hi> ſpeaks, from the mind to the motions and actions of his body, from the conſcience into the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, till it appeare in liberall hands, in righteous lips, and in attentive eares; will breath forth nothing but devotion, but pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Hallelujahs, glory, honour, and praiſe for this his love; and ſo become as the picture, and image, and face of Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting all his favours and graces back upon him; as a Pillar engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with Gods lovingkindneſſes, a Memoriall of Gods goodneſſe thankfully ſet up for ever; and thus to <hi>doe it</hi> is to doe it in <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to conclude; thus if we doe it, if we thus <hi>remember</hi> him, he will alſo <hi>remember</hi> us, remember us, and <hi>ſet us as ſeales upon his heart, and ſignets on his right hand,</hi> remember us as his <hi>peculiar</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and as our remembrance of him takes up all the duty of a Chriſtian, ſo doth his remembrance of us comprehend all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of a Saviour; our love of him, and his love to us are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

And this is the work of the Goſpel, the ſumme of all, the end of all that it teacheth, to work this quietneſſe and peace in us that we may raiſe it up in others, that this peace may beget and propagate it ſelf in thoſe who are enemies to it, that the kid may feed with the wolf, and the Lamb with the Leopard, ſo long as the moone endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; that there may be no deceit, no envy, no violence, no invaſion, no going out, no complaining in our ſtreets.

Look back upon the firſt Chriſtians, who had rather ſuffer the greateſt wrong then do the leaſt; who when for their multitude they might have trod their enemies under their feet, yet yielded themſelves to their fury and rage; who did ſo out-number them, that only to have withdrawn themſelves, had been to have left their perſecutors in baniſhment, to wonder and lament their own pauci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſolitude, and yet bowed down their necks to their yoke, and delivered up their lives to their cruelty, and more willing to reſt in their graves, then be unquiet; and in them this propheſy was fulfilled, their <hi>ſwords</hi> were indeed <hi>turned into mattocks,</hi> and <hi>their ſpeares into pruning hookes,</hi> for all the weapons they had were their <hi>Innocency</hi> and <hi>Patience.</hi> And thus it was for well-neere four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares together; but look forward and then ſee blackneſſe and darkneſſe, noiſe and tempeſts, even in the habitations of peace, Chriſtians reviling and libelling one another, as in the Councel of <hi>Nice;</hi> Chriſtians killing and treading one another under foot, as in the Councel of <hi>Epheſus;</hi> Chriſtians killing one another, as in the quarrell or ſchiſme of <hi>Damaſus</hi> and <hi>Urſicinus;</hi> and then let your eye paſſe on through all the ages of the Church, and if it can for dropping, look upon this laſt, and you will ſee that which will be as a thorne in your eye, and heare that which will make your eares tingle; ſee blood and war, tragedies, and maſſacres, tumult, &amp; confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Chriſtians defranding, curſing, tormenting robbing one another; you ſhould ſee — but the time would faile me to tell you, what

                     <note place="margin">Luk. 24.37.38.</note> for if you be troubled you miſtake Chriſts, and think him to be what he is not; For for all theſe diſmall and horrid events, ſo contrary, ſo unproportioned to the promiſe of God, Chriſt is come in the fleſh, and the propheſie is fulfilled; for all Chriſtians are peaceable men; and whoſoever is obedient to the Goſpel, doth feele and can demonſtrate this power in himſelf: what though we ſee violence and ſtrife in the Church? yet the Church is the houſe of peace; what though <hi>Appius</hi> be unchaſt? we cannot libell the <hi>Decemvirat;</hi> what though <hi>Judas</hi> be a Son of perdition? 'twas the traytor, not the Apoſtle which betrayed Chriſt: If there be controverſies, Religion doth not raiſe them; if there be ſchiſmes, Religion doth not make them; if there be war, Religion doth not beat up the drum; if there be buſie-bodies, Religion doth not imploy them; if there be incendiaries, Religion did not enrage them; if there be a fire in the Church, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian did not kindle it, but the Ambitious man, the <hi>mammoniſt,</hi> the Beaſt that calls himſelf by that name; for Religion cannot do that which ſhe forbids, cannot do that on earth, which damnes to hell; cannot forward that deſign, which is againſt her; cannot ſet up that which will pull her down; in brief, Religion, Chriſtian Religion cannot but ſettle us and make us quiet and peaceable; cannot but be it ſelf; for that which unſettles us, and makes us grievous to our ſelves and others, is not Chriſtian Religion. For Religion is the greateſt preſerver of peace, that ever was, or that Wiſdome it ſelf could find out, and hath laid a fouler blemiſh on diſcord and diſſention, then Philoſophy ever did when ſhe was moſt rigid and ſevere; ſhe commands us to pray for peace, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns us to follow peace with all men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. ſhe enjoynes us to loſe our right for our peace, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>motus aliena naturae pace noſtrâ cohibere,</hi> as <hi>Hilary</hi> ſpeaks, to place a peaceable diſpoſition as a bank or bulwark againſt the violence of anothers rage, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing to conquer him who is in armes; to charme the hiſſing Adder, with ſilence; it levels the hills, and raiſeth the valleys, and caſts an aſpect upon all conditions of men, all qualities, all affections whatſoever, that they may be ſettled, compact, and at unity with themſelves and others.

                  <p>And therefore in the next place, we muſt not onely meditate and contemplate it, but upon all occaſions put it in practice; for meditation may be but the motion and circulation of the fancy; the buſineſſe, or rather the idleneſſe of ſuch men who ſend their thoughts abroad, as boyes throw ſmooth ſtones upon the ſurface of the water, which are loſt in the making; which look and gaze on virtue, and then fly aloft in the contemplation of it, but like thoſe birds of prey which firſt towre in the Aire, and then ſtoop at carrion. We muſt therefore ſecond our meditation, and ratifie, and make it good by practiſe, <hi>faciendo diſcere,</hi> con it more perfectly by being not moved at the incurſion of any evil; learne to paſſe by a petty injury, that we be not caſt down with a greater; not to be envious againſt evil doers, that we may be leſſe troubled at what they do; not to repine at the proſperity of evil men, that we may not be too far exalted with our own, by accuſtoming our ſelves to the ſuffering of this or that evil, proceed and grow up to that compoſedneſſe, that we may endure all; to learn with a foile, that we may fight with a ſword, as <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> uſed to repeat his Orations on the beach, that having ſtood the roaring of the Sea, he might be the leſſe troubled at the noiſe and inſolencie of the people in the Pleading-place.</p>

                  <p>This is our ſpirituall exerciſe, and this we muſt ſtudy; this is the labour and work of our faith, and we muſt practice it every day; and when we have practiced it, practice it again, repeat our leſſon over and over, and be jealous of our ſelves, that we are not yet perfect; as <hi>Petrach</hi> counſells ſtudents, <hi>Sic philoſophari ut philoſophiam amemus,</hi> ſo ſtudy to be quiet, that we may love it, love it as that, which will purchaſe us the love of the God of Peace.</p>

                     </gap>, our love muſt be of that nature, that we muſt love it as that which will crown us with glory, we muſt be ambitious of it. And how do ambitious men ſtretch, and rack their wits? how do they ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to attain firſt one degree of honor, then another, and then the top of all, and then ſtudy again to be higher then the higheſt? for ambition though it do begin with the end, yet it is alwaies a beginning, and this is proper to it, that it never looks back, or conſiders how high it hath ſoar'd; it begins at one kingdome, and then begins at another, and though it make way <hi>ad cubile ſolis,</hi> to the end of the world, yet it doth but begin there. Thus ſhould we be ambitious of quietneſſe of a ſetled mind and a peaceable behaviour, which no mans height can ſink, no mans greatneſſe can diminiſh, no mans anger can move, nomans malice can ſhake, no mans violence can diſorder; as others are of honor, which they muſt win with fire and ſword, <note place="margin">

This is truly Religion, not to hear, and talk, and fill the world with noyſe and confuſion; not to exerciſe our ſelves in things too high for us, but to fight againſt our luſts, and trouble none but our ſelves; though this aged world is grown over-wiſe, and hath found out a way to divorce Religion from honeſty and peace. This is truly Chriſtianity, the command and practice of Chriſt, who would not be an Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between two brethren; <hi>For who,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>hath made me a Judge or Divider over you?</hi> my buſineſſe is to give you generall precepts, which you muſt draw down to particular caſes, and not to put my hand to help to manage the affaires and buſineſſe of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular men, who came down into the world as rain into a fleece of wooll, to beget us with his Word, that we his children might move and walk in the world as he came down into it, that is, without noyſe.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, this is truly honourable, a mark which the ambition of a Chriſtian ſhould flie to; <hi>for it is an honour to ceaſe from ſtrife, Sedere, Quieſcere,</hi> ſo it is rendred, to ſit ſtill and be <hi>quiet; poſſeſſe your ſelves,</hi>

We count it indeed an honor to make our tongues our own, &amp; ſpeak what we liſt; to make our hands our own, and do what we pleaſe; to purſue our enemies and take them, &amp; beat them as ſmall as the duſt before the wind; we count it an honour to ſtand in the valley, and to touch the mountaines till they ſmoke; to reach at that which is above us, and pull it down; to divide that which is united, to ſhake that which is eſtabliſht, to violate that which ſhould not be toucht, and are ever moving and heaving upward to be more than we ſhould be, to be what we ſhould not be; vile, and ignoble, and dead in our own place, &amp; never honorable (we think) till we have left it behind us, to gain us a name, though it be by firing a temple, or ſetting the world it ſelf in Combuſtion.</p>

When Chriſtians out of a wanton and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular zeale did throw down Images, and were ſlaine by the Heathen in the very fact, the Church cenſured them as diſturbers of the peace, rather then Martyrs; and though they ſuffer'd death in the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Idolatry, yet allowed them no place in the Dypticks, or in the Catalogue of thoſe who laid down their life for the truth. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> riſeth out of his place, and the earth ſwallows him up. <hi>Sheba</hi> is up and blowes a Trumpet, and his head flyes over the wall. <hi>Abſalom</hi> would up into the Tribunall, which was none of his place, and was hang'd in the Oke, which was fitter for him; and if any have riſen out of their place, as we uſe to ſay, on the right ſide, and been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate villaines, their purchaſe was not great; honey mingled with gall, Honour drugg'd with the hatred and curſes of men, with feares and cares, with gnawings within, and Terrors without: all the content and pleaſure they had by their great leape out of their place, was but as Muſick to one ſtretcht out on the Rack, or as that little light, which is let in through the crack or flaw of a wall into him that lyes fettered in a loathſome dungeon, and at laſt their wages, which was death, eternall death, and howling for ever. Nay, when we are out of our place, and buſie in that which concernes us not, though what we do may be in it ſelf lawfull, and moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to be done, yet we make that act a ſin in us, which is another mans duty, and ſo ſhipwrack at that point, to which another was bound; periſh in the doing of that, for which he ſhall periſh, for not doing it: The beſt excuſe that we can take up, is that we did

                     <hi>honeſta mente peccare,</hi> that we did that which is evil, as we ſay, for the beſt; that we did ſin and offend God with a good intention and pious mind; which Gloſſe may be fitted to the greateſt ſin, and is the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Chariot the Devil hath, to carry us to hell. If we would be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, the inſtances in this kind would be but too many: For ſuch Agents the Enemy of the Truth hath alwayes had in all the Ages of the Church, who have unſeaſonably diſturbed the publique peace, and their own, whoſe buſineſſe it was (and ſure it could be none of their own) to teach Paſtors to Govern, and Divines how to Preach; every day to make a new coat for the Church; to hammer and ſhape out a new form and diſcipline, as if nothing could be done well, becauſe they ſtood not by and had a hand in the doing it; and ſo make her not ſo faire, but certainly, as changeable as the moone. One ſect diſlikes this, and another that, and a third quarrels at them both; and every one of them, if their own fancy had been ſet up and eſtabliſht by another hand, would have kickt it down. For this humour is reſtleſſe and endleſſe, and for want of matter, will at laſt feed on him that nouriſheth it: as it was in that experiment of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who filled a bag with ſerpents, and when afterwards they opened it, found that the greateſt had eat up the reſt, and half of it ſelf: we may well ſay of them, as <hi>Gregory</hi> the great doth, <hi>illos alienorum actuum ſagax cogitatio devaſtat,</hi> they ſo buſie their thoughts upon other mens actions, that they have none left for their own: which being ſent abroad into the world, leave a devaſtation, a <hi>wilderneſſe at home; which fly to every</hi> mark which is ſet up, but that which their calling and Religion directs them to aim at; whoſe whole life and imployment is to do other mens buſineſſe, and ſleep in their own. It is not ſafe neither for Church nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, that ſuch buſie-bodies ſhould walk in matters ſo far above their ſphere and compaſſe; nor is it fit that <hi>Phaeton</hi> ſhould ſit too long in the chaire; for if theſe turbulent, domineering ſpirits prevaile, if the mercy and providence of God prevent it not, the whole courſe of nature will be ſet on fire, or elſe diſlocated and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; and the foot ſhall ſtand where the hand doth, the eare ſhall ſpeak, and the tongue heare, and the foot ſee; all ſhall be <hi>Prophets,</hi> all <hi>Teachers,</hi> I might ſay, all ſhall be <hi>kings,</hi> and I might add, all will be <hi>atheiſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If then we will ſtudy peace, or deſire to be quiet in our place, let RELIGION guide us, which hath drawn out to our hands the moſt exact method, and moſt proportion'd to that end; or let us follow the method of nature it ſelf; and in the courſe of nature thus we ſee it. The heavens are ſtretcht forth as a canopy to compaſſe the Aire; the Aire moves about the earth; the earth keeps its Center, and is immoveable; the Sun knoweth his ſeaſon, and the Moon her going down; the Starres ſtart not from their ſpheres: Heavy bodies aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:59296:282"/> not, nor doe the light goe downwards; but all the parts of the Univerſe are tyed and linkt together by that law of providence and order, that they may ſubſiſt. And ſo it is both in Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; we are not <hi>in Termino,</hi> we cannot be quiet and reſt, but in our own place and function: what ſhould a Starre doe in the earth, or a ſtrone in the firmament? what ſhould an inferior ſtep into a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours ſeat, and ſet himſelf above thoſe <hi>who are over him in the Lord?</hi> which I am ſure is to be out of his place, where he cannot move but diſorderly. If men would but fill their own, they would have but little leiſure to ſtep into another mans place, or to be ſo much fooles as to ſet their foot within their neighbours doores. <note place="margin">Thucidides.</note> For the Hiſtorian hath obſerved it, that thoſe men who neglect their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate affaires, are ever very buſie in examining publick proceedings; well skil'd in every mans duty but their own.

But the Scripture is truth in every part, and one part cannot contradict another; for we may work with our hands, and yet care no more for the morrow, then if it were no part of time, then if it were nothing; and for ought we know, it is ſo, for who can ſay, he hath a morrow? and we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily reconcile them by the two perſons, The covetous, and the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; for both Texts doe not ſo apparently fit both: Let then the careleſſe and negligent perſon have this goad ſet in his ſide, that if he provide not for his family, <hi>He is worſe then an Infidel;</hi> this Text is infallibly true for him: and then hold back the covetous beaſt with this bit and bridle, that <hi>he muſt not care for the morrow;</hi> and this Text will fit him, <hi>qui ipſa quiete fatigatur,</hi> as <hi>Hilary</hi> ſpeaks, who is weary of nothing more then reſt, and is in labour, if he labour not and drudg in the world; and thus may the careleſſe learne to labour, and the covetous forget to care; the ſluggard may awake from his Lethargy, and the covetous not riſe ſo early, nor make ſuch haſte to be rich; the one Text is as a whip on the back of the ſlothfull, and the other as a chaine to bind the deſires of the covetous; to the one, <hi>labour not;</hi> to the other, <hi>labour</hi> cannot be ſpoken with accent ſharp enough.

                  <p>We muſt not paſſe by the idle and boyſterous gallant, but give him a ſalute, becauſe he looks fot it; for we ſee too many, who have no calling, no profeſſion, <hi>qui volitant velut umbrae,</hi> who flutter up and down like ſhades, and apparitions; like ghoſts, which leave no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion behind them, or ſuch a one, which is as diſhonourable as the hole in a ſlaves Eare, or the mark in the forehead of an Impoſtor: They plough not, they trade not, they preach not, they plead not, they neither ſowe nor reap, yet <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his Royalty was not clothed like one of theſe; nor yet ſo wiſe, as they are in <hi>their own conceits: Salve Getulice,</hi> why ſhould we not bow the knee, and doe them reverence?

                  </p>
                  <p>I know they may reply, that they are born rich, and what they poſſeſſe is theirs by inheritance; this may be true, but yet they were not born fooles, nor were luxury and idleneſſe entail'd upon them at the ſame time; they were born men, and not as the beaſts of the field, to eat and drink, and ſtraggle up and down, and then fall to the ground; were they born to great poſſeſſions? It is then moſt unnaturall to draw this concluſion from hence, that they may doe what they liſt; It will follow rather, that they are more bound to be active in doing of good, that they are more obliged to God which puts that bread into their mouths, which he makes others ſtoop for to the ground. I will not put the ſheephook into their hands, and yet the Patriarchs were ſhepheards; I will not bind them to a trade, yet Kings and Emperours have bound themſelves to one, and made it their recreation; I will not reach to them the Axe or the Chizell, and yet <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>the houſe of David,</hi> and according to the latter, Chriſt himſelf was one; I will not pull their hands to the plough, for then I ſhould take them from Complement, and the Gentleman were loſt: but I cannot think that God gave them plenty, to make them idle; that he did ſo much for them, that they ſhould doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or which is worſe, learne to defie him; give them ſtrength, to make it the law of unrighteouſneſſe; wit, to deſcant on his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to derogate from his miracles, to baffle religion, to laugh at judgement, and to mock at Hell; we cannot think he made them rich, to make them Atheiſts (for nothing elſe can be raiſed upon idleneſſe; not thoſe mountaines of piety and charity, but big and ſwelling imaginations, which exalt themſelves againſt God.) There be other trades beſides thoſe that are Manuall; <hi>vivendi artes,</hi> the Art of good life, the art of compoſing our Affections, the Art of ordering our private affaires, and of being ſubſervient to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, <hi>qua non ſub manunaſcuntur,</hi> which cannot be learnt in the midſt of Riot and wantonneſſe; which will coſt us more paines, then they take, who work with their hands; for ſhould the plough-man turn ſtudent, he would look back upon his former dayes, as ſo many Feſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ivalls, and on his labour as not ſo great, compared with that toile and contention of mind which will ſtretch and rack him in the dayes of his gowne. To conclude this; <hi>non otioſe vivit, qui quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercunque utiliter vivit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aquinas,</hi> he lives not idly who imploys himſelf in doing good, whether as a Divine, or Lawyer, or Tradeſman, or Gentleman, or Lord, or King.

                  <p>Which we may look upon (and we can but look upon it) as a command, and as Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> command. And firſt, it comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command, which makes it neceſſary to be obſerved, and leaves it not to us to do when and how we pleaſe; as neceſſary for us to do, as to believe in Chriſt. For howſoever we may count them as petty duties, and of a lower forme yet our bleſſed Saviour puts an high eſteeme upon them, and upon the leaſt title and <hi>Iota</hi> of them, and <hi>Math.</hi> 5.19. tells us plainly, that if any ſhall break <hi>one of theſe leaſt commandments,</hi> which regulate our converſation with men, <hi>he ſhall be called the leaſt of the kingdome of heaven,</hi> that is, ſhall be of no eſteeme at all, that is, ſhall be ſhut out of that kingdom. For a ſtrange thing it may ſeeme, that faith, and hearing, and prayer, and faſting, and many times but the formality of them, ſhould make up the maine <hi>Battalia</hi> in our ſpirituall warfare, as thoſe three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred did in <hi>Gideons</hi> Army; and thoſe <hi>Omiliticall</hi> virtues, ſilence, peaceableneſſe, honeſty, meekneſſe, doing our own buſineſſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry in our calling, like thoſe who lapped not, ſhould be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, as not fit for ſervice. 'Tis true, the Church is founded upon a rock, upon faith in Chriſt, but then faith implyeth practice, even the practice of thoſe virtues which concern us as members of the Common-wealth as well as of the Church; for the Common-wealth is not in the Church, but the Church in the Common-wealth; for every Common-wealth is not Chriſtian. And as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that he that <hi>knows not how to rule</hi> his own houſe, is not fit to take care of the Church; no more can he who at pleaſure breaks theſe tyes and ligaments, with which nature and Religion have linkt him in a body politick, and that many times under pretence of Religion, boaſt or comfort himſelf in his relation to Chriſt. He that is not a good member of the Common-wealth, is not a true member of the Church; he that is not a good ſervant, or a good maſter; a good governour, or a good ſubject; he that is
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:59296:287"/> not a juſt dealer, an honeſt tradeſman, a faithfull labourer; he that loves not his neighbour as himſelf, he that is not quiet, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and induſtrious (deceive himſelf as he pleaſe) can have nothing but the name of a Chriſtian. For what! will hearing onely, or pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or faſting, lye upon this foundation? was <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> laid as the foundation onely to bear up ſpeculative and fancifull men, onely to beare up Phariſees and hypocrites? will not diſcretion, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſilence, and honeſty and diligence in our calling concur to that ſuperſtructure which muſt riſe up as high as heaven? will our eye, or tongue, or eare, or knee, or fancy bowe and incline God, and will he not once look down upon our order, upon our peaceable, and honeſt converſation with men? Is Religion turned anchoret, and ſhut up within our ſelves, there onely to liſten after words and ſounds, &amp; breathe them out again? and muſt not ſhe come forth to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our ſteps amongſt men? may ſhe not be ſeene in a ſettled mind, and eye; in a labouring hand, as well as in an open eare, and a buſie tongue, which ſpeaks loud and oft of Gods kingdom, when we do thoſe things which will ſhut us out? Let us not deceive our ſelves; <hi>to be quiet, to meddle in our own buſineſſe, to labour with our hands,</hi> are <hi>ſubpraecepto,</hi> are under the command, and binding, and are tendred to us, and preſcribed as a law. Indeed nature and Reaſon, one would think, ſhould bind us, and guide our motion in that ſphere, or place, wherein we are fixt; for why ſhould not every man be what he is made to be? and although I do not think that every command in the Goſpel, is <hi>juris naturalis,</hi> and ſo made known to us by the light of nature (for nature certainly could not teach us to dye for our brethren, which yet the Goſpel doth) yet there is nothing commanded there, which carryes not with it a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall dignity and beſeemingneſſe, to which, with a little inſtruction, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vide Grot.</hi> l. r. de Jur. Bell. &amp; pac. c. 12. Sect. 6.</note> and upon ſerious conſideration, we ſhall willingly ſubſcribe. And theſe duties, which we now ſpeak of, may ſeeme clearly to iſſue from thoſe dictates of nature, <hi>that we ſhould do to others, as we would be done to;</hi> that all things ſhould be <hi>done decently and to edification. That nothing ſhould be done againſt conſcience;</hi> which had been of force for the ordering of mens actions of this nature, though the Scripture had never expreſſed them, and were of force before the Goſpel was written, and did bind us, not onely becauſe they were written, but becauſe they were juſt. For why ſhould he who would not be ſpoyled himſelf, rob another? why ſhould he who makes his houſe his caſtle, be ſo ready to invade, and break into his neighbours? why ſhould he who is even ſick of a cheate, be ſo ready to put one upon anorher? why ſhould be that would be quiet at home, be ſo troubleſome abroad? why ſhould not <hi>Ahab</hi> be as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with his crown, as to take <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard? But Chriſt, the beſt maſter and law-giver that ever was, came not to deſtroy, but to perfect nature; not to blot out thoſe common notions which
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:59296:288"/> we brought into the world with us, but to make them more legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to improve them, and ſo make them his Law; and if we look upon them as not belonging to us, we our ſelves cannot belong to the covenant of grace; for even theſe duties are weaved in, and made a part of the covenant; and if we break the one, we break the other; and not onely if we believe not, but if we live not peaceably; if we ſtretch beyond our line; if we labour not in our calling, we ſhall not enter into his reſt. For theſe alſo are his Laws, and theſe doth our bleſſed Apoſtle teach and command.</p>
                  <p>And, to conclude; ſuch a power hath Chriſt left in his Church, conferred it firſt on his Apoſtles, and thoſe who were to ſucceed and ſupply their place, who were to ſpeak after them in the perſon and in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we will not diſpute now what power it is; it is ſufficient to ſay, it is not an Earthly, but a Heavenly Power, derived from Chriſt himſelf, the Fountain and originall of all power whatſoever. As Chriſts kingdom is not of this world, ſo is not this power of that nature, as to ſtand in need of an Army of Souldiers to defend and hold it up, but is like to the object and matter it works upon, ſpirituall; a power to command, to remember every man of his duty in the Church or Common-wealth; for the Church and Common-wealth are two diſtinct, but not contrary things, and both powers were ordained to uphold and defend each other; the civill power to exalt Religion, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to guard and fence the civill power, and both ſhould concur in this, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all Godlineſſe and honeſty. Our commiſſion is from heaven, and we need no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power then his, that ſealed it, and the virtue and Divinity of it ſhall then be made manifeſt, when all earthly power ſhall ceaſe, and even Kings and they who did what they liſt, ſhall tremble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. We ſee, that power which is exerciſed here on earth, though the glory of it dazle an eye of fleſh, yet ſits heavy upon them who weare it; we ſee it tortures them, that delight in it; eats up them that feed on't; eats up it ſelf, and driving all before it at laſt falls it ſelf to the ground, and falls as a milſtone upon him that hath it, and bruiſeth him to pieces. It is not ſuch a power, but I may be bold to ſay, though it be lookt upon, &amp; laught at, &amp; deſpiſed by the men of this world, yet is it a greater power than that, which ſometimes ſets it up on high, and ſometimes makes it nothing, and hath its end, when it hath not its end; for to publiſh our maſters will, to command in his name is all; and though the command prove to ſome the <hi>savour of death unto death,</hi> yet the power is ſtill the ſame, and doth never faile; and if men were, what they profeſſe themſelves, Chriſtians; if they had any taſte of the powers of the world to come, they would more tremble at this, then at the other; be more afraid of a juſt reproof, then a whip; of an excommunication,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:59296:288"/> then a ſword; of the wrath of God, which is yet ſcarce viſible, then of that which comes in fire and tempeſt to devour us; for his favour, or his wrath ever accompanies this power, which draws his love neerer to them that obey it, and poures forth his vengeance on them that reſiſt it.</p>
                  <p>To conclude then; look upon the command, and honor the Apoſtle that brings it; for the commands ſake; for his ſake, whoſe power, and command it is. A power there is proper and peculiar to them, who are called to it; and if the name of power may move envy (for we ſee men fret at that which was ordeined for their good, and ſo waſt and exhale all their Religion till it be nothing) if the name of power beare ſo harſh a ſound, we will give you leave to think it is not much materiall, whether you call it ſo or no; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſpeak in the imperative mood, <hi>hoc fac, do this</hi> upon your pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill; or onely poſitively point as with the finger, <hi>this is to be done:</hi> we will be any thing, do any thing, be as low as you pleaſe, ſo we may raiſe you above the vanities of the world, above that wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which ſtormes at that, which was ordained for no other end, but to lift you out of ruine, into the higheſt heavens. Our power, and the command of Chriſt differ not ſo much, but the one includes and upholds the other; and if you did but once love the command, you would never boggle at the name of power, but bleſſe and honour him that brings it.</p>
                  <p>Oh that men were wiſe! but ſo wiſe, as not to be wiſer then God, as not to chooſe and fall in love with their own wayes as more certain, and direct unto the end, then Gods; as not to preferre their own mazes and Labyrinths, and uncertain gyrations drawn out by luſt and fancy, before thoſe even and unerring paths found out by an infinite wiſdome, and diſcovered to us by a mercy as infinite; oh that we could once work out and conquer the hardſhip of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and then ſee the beauty of it, and to what glory it leads us; we ſhould then receive an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the name of an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and look upon the command, though brought in an earthen veſſell, as upon heaven it ſelf; oh that we were once ſpirituall; then thoſe precepts which concern our converſation on earth, would be laid hold on and embraced, as from the Heaven Heavenly; then ſhould we be as quiet as the Heavens, which are ever moving, and ever at reſt, becauſe ever in their own place; then ſhould we be as the Angels of Heaven, who envy not one another, malice not one another, trouble not one another, but every Angel knows his office, and moves in his own order; and our aſſiduous labour in our calling would be a reſemblance of the readyneſſe of thoſe bleſſed ſpirits, who at the beck of Majeſty have wings, and haſte to their duty; who are ever moving, and then in their higheſt exaltation, when they
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:59296:289"/> are in their miniſtery. In aword; then ſhould we every one ſit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own vine, and figtree, and no evill eye ſhould look towards him, no malice blaſt him, no injury aſſault him, no bold intruſion unſettle him; but we ſhould all rejoyce together, the poore with the rich, the weak with the ſtrong, the low with the high, all bleſſe one another, help one another, guard one another, and ſo in the name of the prince of peace walk peaceably together, every one moving in his own place, till we reach that peace, which yet we do not underſtand, but ſhall then fully enjoy to all Eternity.</p>

God did not command, but did accept them for the zeal and affection of them who offered them up; and he tells them ſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>I ſpeake not to your Fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning Burnt-offerings or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: But this thing I commanded them, ſaying, Obey my voyce.

                  <p>Secondly, when they were commanded, they were commanded not for any reall goodneſſe there was naturally in them, (for what are Blood and ſmoke to the God of ſpirits?) but brought in for that good effect which the wiſdome of God could work out of them, which had nothing of Good in them, nor which might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them, but the end for which they were ordained. And therefore he commanded them, not as deſireable in themſelves, but by way of condeſcenſion, ſubmitting himſelf, as it were, to the preſent infirmity and condition of the Jews, who were ſo ſtrongly affected to this kind of worſhip; <hi>Populum pronum Idololatriae, ejuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modi officiis religioni ſuae voluit aſtringere,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian;</hi> God put this command, <note place="margin">Tertull<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>And ſo they were good, but <hi>ex comparatione,</hi> but by being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with ſomething that was worſe: If they will ſacrifice, it is
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:59296:291"/> better they ſacrifice to God then to Devils; better do this then worſe; better do that, which had it not been commanded, had been neither good nor evil, then that which is abſolutely evil; bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter do that which God can beare with, then that which he hates; better they ſhould be under the reſtraint and managing of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent hand, then that they ſhould run into thoſe abominations which a Father cannot pardon, and which will make a loving and tender God, a conſuming fire. Thus they are Good being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with ſomething that is worſe, and being put into the ſcales together, are valuable, becauſe they outweigh them: <hi>Et quale eſt Bonum, quod mali comparatio commendat?</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian;</hi> what good is that, which were not ſo, if the evil which it ſhuts out, and with which it is compared, did not commend it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That which is good in it ſelf and its own nature, is alwaies ſo; piety and true Religion is older then the world, for it is a part and beame of that wiſdome which was with God from Everlaſting, and it ſhines forth from one end of the world to the other; hath the ſame ſplendor and brightneſſe, when the faſhion of the world changeth every day; and binds alike all the men in the world, and ends not but with it, and in its effects continues, when that ſhall be diſſolved, even to all eternity: as it was breathed from God, and flows from his eternall law, ſo it is alwaies the ſame, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines the ſame, till it end in glory. For this there is no <hi>conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum eſt,</hi> there is no end. The vaile of the temple is rent in twaine, the temple it ſelf is buried in ruine, and not a ſtone left upon a ſtone; every Altar is throwne down, the ſacrifices and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies aboliſht, but <hi>quicquid condidit virtus, coelum eſt,</hi> That which is truely good is as laſting as the heavens: heaven and earth may paſſe away, but not one tittle of this <hi>good</hi> ſhall fall to the ground.</p>

It is never out of ſeaſon, never out of its place. Every day is the good mans holiday, and his ſacrifice may be offered up at any time: It ſtayes not for the new moone, or Sabbath day, but is <hi>res omnium horarum,</hi> may ſhew and diſplay it ſelf at any day, in every houre of that day, and every minute of that houre. Ever yay, every houre, every minute is the good mans Sabbath and reſt. And as it is not tied to time, no more is it to place: <hi>All the ends of the world ſhall

                  <p>Laſt of all: This Ceremonious part of Religion was many times omitted, many times diſpenſed with; but this <hi>good</hi> which is here ſhewn, admits no diſpenſation: Circumciſion was diſpenſed with; ſacrifice was diſpenſed with; the Sabbath was diſpencſed with; but the true ſervice of God was ever in force: who ever was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with in a morall and poſitive law? who ever had this indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence granted him to defraud or oppreſſe his brother, to be cruell and unmercifull to him, or to walk contrary to his God? who ever was unjuſt on earth by a grant and prerogative from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? <hi>Aliud ſunt imagines, aliud definitiones; Imagines prophetant, definitiones gubernant,</hi>

When Sacrifices were omitted, and the Sabbath for ſome reaſons was not obſerved, God complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not; we find that in a manner he doth diſclaim Sacrifice, as in this place, and in the 1. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and in the 50. <hi>Pſal.</hi> but where doth he hold a controverſie with his people for omitting it? What Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was there almoſt, which was not at ſome time, and upon ſome juſt occaſion neglected? How many Eaſters? How many Jubilees doe we read of?

For it was obſerved even by ſome of the Jews themſelves, That the greateſt Sacrificers were moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the greateſt Sinners, who converſing ſo much with ſhadows, and loſt in the admiration of them, had no thought left empty
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:59296:292"/> enough to entertain the more ſubſtantiall and harder parts of the Law, were ſo buſie on the one, that they caſt no look on the other; but in the ſtrength of their Sacrifice, and a high conceit of this their formall worſhip, walkt careleſly, and delicately over them, even to that which they forbad; So that to ſay, He is a true Iſraelite, becauſehe is frequent at the Altar, is no better an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then that which the Stoick ſo much derides, <hi>He hath a long Cloak and Beard, Therefore he is a great Philoſopher:</hi>

                     </gap>, as the Stoick calls it of the Iſraelite, is to doe juſtice, and love mercy, as the Philoſophers is in all his actions to make Reaſon his Rule. Caſt but your eye back upon ſome former paſſages in this Prophecy, and you ſhall find that theſe Sacrificers were Idolaters, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. That they were Oppreſſors, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. That in the night they did <hi>ſtudy iniquity,</hi> and in the morning <hi>practice</hi> it: That they did <hi>covet Fields, and take them by violence; oppreſſe a man and his houſe, even a man and his heritage, ver.</hi> 1, 2.

That they were unjuſt, and ignorant, and ungratefull in this Chapter, all which they did beare with eaſe, when they led their Sacrifice to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and there laid them to vaniſh aay with that ſmoke. It is a wonderfull thing to obſerve, how ſoon and eaſily we are perſwaded to think well of our ſelves in our worſt condition; how a forme of Religion will ſecure us to tread it under our feet; how the doing that which is not good in it ſelf, will lift us up and make us active and cheerfull in doing that which is abſolutely evil; how the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer we come unto hell, the leſſe we feare it; bring a ſacrifice, ſet fire to your incenſe, bowe the knee, call upon that God, whom you blaſpheme, and there will then be no more conſcience of ſinne. And therefore in this ſo great abuſe, God is forced to give a check to his own command, and preciſely to except againſt that Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that part of worſhip which himſelf for ſome reaſons had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned: when their hands were full of blood, then <hi>Satur eſt,</hi> then is he alſo full, troubled and wearied with their burnt offrings, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 1.14. then he asks the Queſtion by his Prophet; <hi>will I be pleaſed with thouſands of Ramme?</hi> that is, I will not. <note place="margin">

                  <p>We may then learn thus much from the Prophets Queſtion, That the Ceremonious part of Gods worſhip, though enjoyned by God, and performed moſt exactly by men, yet if it be not driven to that end, for which it was commanded, is ſo far from finding ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God, that it is odious and hatefull in his ſight.

The firſt alwaies have reference to the laſT, and if they come alone, or with no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a retinue then thoſe ſinnes and irregularities which they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, then God removes them, as he did the high places; cuts them down as he did the groves; looks upon them with the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation as he doth upon Idols; <note place="margin">2 King. 18.4.</note> as he did upon the brazen ſerpent, when the people did burn Incenſe to it, which, though it was lifted up in the wilderneſſe by his command, yet by his command it was pulled down and broken to pieces by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and made <hi>Nehuſhtan,</hi> a lump of braſſe.</p>
                  <p>For 1. theſe outward performances of ſome part, and the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt part of the law, were not done out of any love to the law or the Law-giver. For love is of a quick and operative nature, and cannot reſt in ſhews and formalities, but will draw them home to the end for which they were ordained: Love preſents the gift, and the heart alſo, and (before he comes to the Altar) makes the worſhipper himſelf a ſacrifice. Love doth not ſtay at the porch, but enters the <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holyes;</hi> doth not ſtay in the beginnings, but haſteth to the end; doth not contract the duty, but extends it to the utmoſt; doth not draw pictures, but men; doth not ſacrifice the beaſt onely, but offers and conſumes us, binds us wholly to the work, forceth, and conſtrains us; never lets us reſt, till we have fulfilled the will of him that commands; Improves ſacrifice to obedience; hearing, to practice; faſting, to humility and repentance; Love may begin, but never ends in ceremony. And this is the reaſon why Religion hath ſo many profeſſors, and ſo few friends; ſo many ſalutes, and ſo many contempts flung upon her; why ſhe is ſo much ſpoke of, as the bird of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> that eagle which muſt carry us to heaven, but hath no more regard, then the ſparrow on the houſe top or the owle in the deſart; why it is ſo much talkt of and ſo little practiced; for men do not love it, but becauſe it carries a kind of majeſty and beauty along with it, and ſtrikes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eye that beholds it; becauſe men ſpeak well of her in the gates,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:59296:293"/> and we cannot but ſpeak well of her, whileſt we are men; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are willing to give her a ſalute in the midſt of all thoſe horrid and helliſh offices which are ſet up againſt her; we give her a bowe and let her paſſe by, as if her ſhadow could cure us; or we lay hold on the skirts of her garment, touch and kiſſe them; are loud and buſie in the performance of the eaſieſt part of it; bind the ſacrifice with cords to the hornes of the Altar, but not our luſts and irregular deſires, but let them fly to every object, every vanity; which is to ſacrifice a beaſt to God, and our ſelves to the devil.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Theſe formall worſhippers do not onely not love the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but they do it for the love of ſomething elſe: They love oppreſſion, and blood, and injuſtice better then ſacrifice; and all this heat and buſie induſtry at the Altar proceeds not from that love which ſhould be kindled and diffuſed in the heart, but as the unruly tongue, is ſet on fire by hel;; hath no other originall, then an ungrounded, and unwarranted love of thoſe profitable and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable evils, which we have ſet up as our mark, but cannot ſo fairely reach to, if we ſtand in open defiance to all Religion. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when that will not joyne with us, but looks a contrary way to that to which we are preſſing forward with ſo much eagerneſſe, we content our ſelves with ſome part of it, with the weakeſt, with the pooreſt and beggerlyeſt part of it, and make uſe of it to go along with us, and countenance and ſecure us, in the doing of that which is oppoſite to it, and with which it cannot ſubſiſt; and ſo well and feelingly we act our parts, that we take our ſelves to be great favourites, and in high grace with him whoſe laws we break; and ſo procure ſome reſt and eaſe from thoſe continuall clamors, which our guiltineſſe would otherwiſe raiſe within us, and walk on with delight and boaſting, and through this ſeeming, feigned para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe poſt on ſecurely to the gates of death. In what triumphant meaſures doth a Phariſee go from the Altar? what a harmeleſſe thing is a cheat after a Sermon? what a ſweet morſell is a widdows houſe after <hi>Long Prayers?</hi> what a piece of Juſtice is oppreſſion after a faſt?

                     <pb n="469" facs="tcp:59296:294"/> tells us, to ſee the works of God brought into ſubjection under man, who was made according to his image; ſo is it his pride and glory to ſee man and Religion it ſelf brought under theſe tranſitory things, &amp; even made fervants and ſlaves unto them: O! to this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of God and man, it is a kind of heaven in hell it ſelf, and in the midſt of all his torment, to ſee this man, whom God created and redeemed, to do him the greateſt ſervice in Chriſts livery; to ſee him promote his Intereſt in the name of Chriſt and Religion; to ſee him under his power and dominion moſt, when he waits moſt diligently and officiouſly at the Altar of God. The Phariſee was his beloved diſciple, when he was on his knees with a diſſigured face: Theſe Jews here were his diſciples, who did run to the Altar, but not from their evil waies; who offered up the blood of beaſts to God, and of the innocent to him; he that faſts and oppreſſes, is his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, for he gives God his body, and the Devil his ſoule: He that prayes much, and cozens more, is his diſciples; for he doth but flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God, and ſerves the enemy, ſpeaks to a God of truth with his lips, but hearkens to the Father of lyes and deceit. I may ſay the divel is the great Alchymiſt of the world to tranſelement the worſt things, to make them more paſſible, to add a kind of eſteeme and glory to them. We do not meet with Counterfeit Iron or Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but gold and precious ſtones, theſe we ſophiſticate, and when we cannot dig them out of the mine, or take them from the rock, we ſtrive to work them by art out of Iron, or Copper, or glaſſe, and call them gold and diamonds. Thus doth the Devil raiſe and ſublime the greateſt impiety, and gild it over with a ſacrifice, with a faſt, with devotion, that it may appeare in glory, and deceive, if it were poſſible, the very elect: we ſee too many deceived with it, who having no Religion themſelves, are yet ready to bowe down to its Image whereſoever they ſee it, and ſo fix their eye and devotion upon it, that they ſee not the theef, the oppreſſor, the Atheiſt, who carries it along with him, to deſtroy that of which it is the Image; but take it for that which it repreſents, as little children and fooles take pictures and puppets for men. Is he unclean? who ſees that, when he is at the Altar? doth he defraud his brother? who would ſay ſo, that ſhould ſee him on his knees? hath he falſe weights and ballances? It is impoſſible, for you may ſee him eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day in the temple: are his feet ſwift to ſhed blood? It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, for he faſteth often, behold how he hangs down his head like a bulruſh. The veine of gold is deep in the earth, and we cannot reach it but with ſweat and induſtry: true piety and that which is good is a more rare and precious thing then gold, and the veines of it ly deep; its originall is from heaven in Chriſt, at a huge diſtance from our carnall deſires and luſts, and ſo requires great anxiety, ſtrong contention, and mighty ſtrivings to reconcile it to our wills. This pearle is as it were in a far country, and we muſt ſell
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:59296:295"/> all to purchaſe it; the whole man muſt loſe, and deny it ſelf to ſearch and find it out; we muſt lay down all that we have, our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, our wills and affections at his feet that ſells it: And therefore that we may not trouble, nor excruciate our ſelves too much, that we may not aſcend into heaven, or go down into hell for it, that we may not undergoe ſo much labour, and endure ſo much torment in attaining it, e take a ſhorter way, and work and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſomething like unto it, which is moſt contrary to it, and tranſele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment impiety it ſelf, and ſhadow it over with devotion, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it to others, and ſay within our ſelves, this is it. For what <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid of Philoſophy is true of Religion, <hi>Adeo res ſacra eſt, ut ſiquid illi ſimile ſit, etiam mendacium placeat,</hi> It is ſo ſacred and venerable a thing, that we are pleaſed with its reſemblance, and that ſhall ſoone have its name that hath but its likeneſſe; that ſhall be the true pearle, which is but counterfeit; and by this means all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is confined to the Altar, and that ſhall conſecrate that which is not <hi>good,</hi> and make it appeare ſo. That piety which came from the boſome of the Father, and was conveighed to us by the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Sonne, muſt be ſhut up in outward worſhip, in forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and Ceremony, and ſhew, and that which quite deſtroyes it, and tramples it under our feet; muſt go under that name, and make us great on earth, though it make us the leaſt in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, ſo that we ſhall have no place there, but be tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled down into the loweſt pit. As the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks in his firſt chapter; <hi>Argentum noſtrum verſum eſt in ſcoriam,</hi> our ſilver is become droſſe, our wine is mixt with water, nay our beſt ſilver, our moſt refined actions are droſſe; our wine is gall and bitterneſſe, or as he ſpeaks in another place c. 30. all our <hi>Righteouſneſse</hi> (and he means ſuch formal, counterfeit righteouſneſſe,) is <hi>as a menſtruous cloth.</hi>

We read in the Hiſtorian, when <hi>Nero</hi> had but ſet his foot into the temple of <hi>Veſta,</hi> he fell into a fit
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:59296:296"/> of trembling, <hi>facinorum recordatione,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tacitus,</hi> being ſhaken with the remembrance of his monſtrous crimes; for what ſhould he do in the temple of <hi>Veſta,</hi> who had defiled his own mother? And how ſhall we dare to enter Gods courts, unleſſe we leave our ſinnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind us? how dare we ſpeak to a God of truth, who defraud ſo many? why ſhould we faſt from meat, who make our brethren our meat, and eat them up? at that great day of ſeparation of true and falſe worſhippers, when he ſhall beſpeake thoſe on his right hand, <hi>Come ye lleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for you;</hi> The forme or reaſon is not, for you have ſacrificed often, you have faſted often, you have heard much, you were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the temple; and yet theſe are holy duties, but they are <hi>ordinata ad aliud,</hi> they were ordained for thoſe that follow, and therefore are not mentioned, but in them implyed: <hi>For I was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and you gave me meat; I was thirſty, and you gave me drink; I was naked, and you clothed me; ſick and in priſon, and you viſited me.</hi> Then outward worſhip hath its glory and reward, when it drawes the inward along with it; then the ſacrifice hath a ſweet-ſmelling ſavour, when a juſt and mercifull man offers it up; when I ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and obey, heare and do, pray and endeavour, contemplate and practice, faſt and repent: and thus we are made one, fit to be lookt upon by him who is <hi>Oneneſſe</hi> it ſelf, not divided betwixt ſacrifice and oppreſſion; a forme of godlineſſe, and an habituall courſe in ſinne; a diſſembling with God, and fighting againſt him; betwixt an <hi>Hoſanna</hi> and a <hi>Crucifige,</hi> a profeſſing Chriſt, and Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing him. In this unnity and conjunction every duty and virtue, as the ſtars in the firmament, have their ſeverall glory, and they make the <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> the Chriſtian, a child of light: but if we divide them, or ſet up ſome few for all; the eaſieſt and thoſe which are moſt attempered to the ſence, for thoſe which fight againſt it; and bring in them for the maine, which by themſelves are nothing; if all muſt be ſacrifice, if all muſt be Ceremony and outward forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; if this be the concluſion and ſumme of the whole matter, If this be the body of our worſhip and Religion; then inſtead of a bleſſing and an <hi>Euge,</hi> we ſhall meet with a frown and a check; and God will queſtion us for appearing before him in <hi>ſtrange apparell,</hi> which he never put upon us; queſtion us for doing his command, and tell us he never gave any ſuch command, becauſe he gave it not to this end: will he be pleaſed with burnt offerings? with Ceremony, and formality? he asks the queſtion with ſome indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and therefore 'tis plain he will not, but loaths the ſacrifice, as he doth the oppreſſor, and unclean perſon that brings it.</p>
                  <p>We ſee then (that we may yet draw it neerer to us) that there was good reaſon why God ſhould thus diſclaime his own ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, becauſe he made it for their ſakes, and to an end quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:59296:296"/> to that, to which the Jew carried it; we ſee the Prophet might well ſet ſo low an eſteeme upon ſo many thouſand rams, becauſe Idolaters, and oppreſſors, and cruell blood-thirſty men offered them. We ſee Sacrifice and all out ward Ceremony and formality are but as the garment or ſhadow of Religion, which is turned into a diſguiſe, when ſhe weares it not; and is nothing, is a deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when it doth not follow her. For oppreſſion and ſacriledge may put on the ſame garment; and the greateſt evil that is, may caſt Wuch a ſhadow. He that hates God may ſacrifice to him; he that blaſphemes him, may praiſe him; The hand that ſtrips the poore may put fire to the incenſe, and the feet that are ſo ſwift to ſhed bloud, may carry us into the Temple. When all is Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, all is vaine, nay lighter then vanity; for in this we doe not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, but mock him; give him the skin, when he looks for the heart; we give him ſhadows for ſubſtances, and ſhews for realities, and leaves for fruit; and we mortifie our luſts and affections, as Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedians die upon the Stage, and are the ſame ſinners we were, as wicked as ever. Our Religion puts forth no thing but bloſſomes, or if it knit, and make ſome ſhew or hope of fruit, it is but as we ſee it in ſome Trees, it ſhoots forth at length, and into a larger proportion and bigneſs, then if it had had its natural concoction, and ripened kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and then it hath no taſt or relliſh, but withers, and rots, and falls off. And thus when we too much dote on Ceremomy, we neglect the maine work, and when we neglect the work, we fly to Ceremony and formality, and lay hold on the Altar; we deale with our God, <note place="margin">Clem.

                  <p>I will not accuſe the foregoing Ages of the Church, becauſe as they were loud for the Ceremonious part of Gods worſhip, ſo were they as ſincere in it, and did worſhip him in ſpirit and truth, and were equally zealous in them both; and though they raiſed the firſt to a great height, yet never ſuffered it ſo to over-top the other, as to put out its light; but were, what their outward expreſſions ſpake them, as full of Piety as Ceremony; and yet we ſee that high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem which they had of the Sacraments of the Church, led ſome
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:59296:297"/> of them upon thoſe errors, which they could not well quit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of, but by falling into worſe. It is on all hands agreed, that they are not abſolutely neceſſary, not ſo neceſſary as the mortifying and denying of our ſelves, not ſo neceſſary as Actuall holineſſe. It is not abſolutely neceſſary to be baptized; for many have not paſſed that Jordan, yet have been ſaved; but it is neceſſary to have the <hi>Laver of Regeneration,</hi> and to clenſe our ſelves from ſin. It is not abſolutely neceſſary to eat the Bread, and drink the Wine in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; for ſome croſſe accident may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene, and put me by; but it is neceſſary to feed on the Bread of Life, as neceſſary as my meat, to doe Gods will. True Piety is abſolutely neceſſary, becauſe none can hinder me from that, but my ſelfe; but it is not alwayes in every mans power to bring himſelfe to the Font, or approach the Lords Table; All that can be ſaid, is, That when they may be had, they are abſolutely neceſſary; but they are therefore not abſolutely neceſſary, becauſe they cannot alwaies be had; and when they ſtretcht beyond this, they ſtretcht beyond their line, and loſt themſelves in an ungrounded, and unwarranted admiration of theſe Ordinances, which (whilſt we look upon them in their proper Orbe and Compaſſe) can never have honour and eſteem enough. They put the Communion into the mouthes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, who had but now their Being; and into the mouthes of the Dead, who had indeed a BEing, but not ſuch a Being as to be fit Communicants; and Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> thought Baptiſme of Infants ſo abſolutely neceſſary, that Not to be baptized, was to be Damned, and therefore was forced alſo to create a new Hell that was never before heard of, and to find out <hi>mitem damnationem,</hi> a more mild and eaſie damnation, more fit, as he thought, for the tenderneſſe and innocency of Infants.</p>
                  <p>Now this was but an error in ſpeculation, the error of devout and pious men, who in honour to the Author of the Sacraments, made them more binding and neceſſAry then they were; and we may learn thus much by this over-great eſteem the firſt and beſt Chriſtians, and the moſt learned amongſt them, had of them; that there is more certainly due, then hath been given in theſe latter times, by men who have learnt to deſpiſe all Learning, and whoſe great devotion it is to quarrell and cry down all Devotion: who can find no way to gain the reputation of Wiſdome, but by the fierce and loud im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning of that which hath been practiced and commended to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages by the wiſeſt in their Generation; by men who firſt cry down the Determinations of the Church, and then in a ſcornfull and profane pride and animoſity deny there is any ſuch Collection, or Body, as a Church at all.</p>
                  <p>But our Errors in Practice are more dangerous, more ſpreading,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:59296:297"/> more univerſall. For what is our eſteem of the Sacraments? more a great deale then theirs, and yet leſſE, becauſe 'tis ſuch which we ſhould not give them, even ſuch, which they, whom they are ſo bold to Cenſure, would have Anathematized. We Think, or Act as if we did, that the Water of Baptiſme doth clenſe us, though we make our ſelves more Leopards, fuller of ſpots then before: That the Bread in the Euchariſt will nouriſh us up to eternall life, though we feed on husks in all the remainder of our dayes. We baptize our children, and promiſe and voew for them, and then inſtill thoſe thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and worldly principles into them, which null and cancell the vow we made at the Font: hither we bring them to renounce the world, and at home teach them to love it. And for the Lords Supper, what is commonly our preparation? A Sermon, a few houres of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a ſeeming farewell to our common affaires, a faint heaving at the heart that will not be lifted up, a ſad and demure countenance at the time; and the next day, nay before the next day this miſt is ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and we are ready to give Mammon a ſalute, and a cheerfull countenance, the world our ſervice, to drudge and toyle as that ſhall lead us, to rayle as loud, to revenge as maliciouſly, to wanton it as ſportfully, to cheat as kindly as ever we did long before, when we never ſo much as thought of a Sacrament. And ſhall we now place all Religion, nay any Religion in this? or call that good, that abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely good and neceſſary, for which we are the worſe, abſolutely the worſe every day? Well may God ask the queſtion, <hi>Will he be pleaſed with this?</hi> Well may he by one Prophet ask, <hi>who hath requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it?</hi> and by another inſtruct us, and ſhew us yet <hi>a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was not the error of the Jew alone to forget true and inward ſanctity, and to truſt upon outward worſhip and formality; but ſad experience hath taught us, that the ſame error which miſled the Jew under his <hi>weak and beggerly Elements,</hi> hath in the fulneſſe of time found admittance and harbour in the breaſts of Chriſtians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eer that perfect Law of Liberty, in which the grace of God hath appeared unto all men. I am unwilling to make the parallel; it carries with it ſome probability that ſome of them had that groſſe conceit of God, that he fed on the fleſh of bulls, and drunk the blood of goates; for God himſelf ſtands up and denies it in the fiftieth Pſalme, <hi>will I eat the fleſh of bulls, and drink the blood of goates? If I be hungry, I will not tell thee:</hi> if there were not ſuch conceit, why doth God thus expoſtulate? And is there no ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome, no indication of this diſeaſe in us? do we not believe that God delights in theſe pageants and formalities? That he better likes the devotion of the ear, then of the heart? do we not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure out our devotion rather by the many Sermons which we have heard, then the many almes we have given? or which is better,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:59296:298"/> the many evill thoughts which we have ſtifled, the many unruly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires we have ſuppreſt, the many paſſions we have ſubdued, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny temptations which we have conquered? Hath not this been our Arithmetick, to caſt uup our accounts, not by the many good deeds we have done, which may ſtand for figures or numbers; but by the many reproches we have given to the times, the many bitter Cenſures we have paſt upon men better then our ſelves; the many Sermons we have heard, which many times (God knowes) are no better then Cyphers, and by themſelves ſignifie no more? Do we not pleaſe our ſelves with theſe thoughts, and lift our ſelves up into the third heaven? Do we not think, that God is well pleaſed with theſe thoughts? Do we not believe they are ſacrifices of a ſweet-ſmelling favour unto him? And what is this leſſe, then to think that God will eat the fleſh of bulls, and drink the blood of goates? nay may it not ſeeme far worſe, to think that God is fed and delighted with our formalities, which are but lyes, and that he is in love with our hypocriſie? I may be bold to ſay, as groſſe an error and as oppoſite to the wiſdome of God, as the other. It is truely ſaid, <hi>multa non illicita vitiat animus,</hi> That the mind and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of man may draw an obliquity on thoſe actions which in themſelves are lawfull; nay <hi>multa mandata vitiat,</hi> It may make that unlawfull, which is commanded. O! 'tis a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of the living God; but how fearefull is it to have his hand fall upon us, when we ſtan dat his Altar? to ſee him frown and hear him thunder, when we worſhip him; in anger to queſtion us, when we are doing our duty? What a dart would it be to pierce our ſoules through and through, if God ſhould now ſend a Prophet to us, to tell us, That our frequenting the Church, and comming to his Table, are diſtaſtfull to him; That our faſts are not ſuch as he hath choſen, and that he hates them as much as he doth our oppreſſion and cruelty, to which they may be as the prologue; that he will have none of the one, becauſe he will have none of the other? and yet if we terminate Religion in theſe outward formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or make them waite upon our luſts, to bring them with more ſmoothneſſe, with more ſtate and pomp, and applauſe to their end, to that which they look ſo earneſtly upon; if we thus appear before him, he that ſhall tell us as much of our hearing, and faſting, and frequenting the Church, ſhall be as a true Prophet as <hi>Micah</hi> the <hi>Moraſthite</hi> was.</p>

We need not cull out any more then theſe in the Text; for in offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up theſe, we ſhall find the true nature and reaſon of a Sacrifice obſerved. For to make any thing a true Sacrifice, there muſt be a plain and expreſſed change of the thing that is offered. It was a Bull or a Ram, but it is ſet apart and conſecrate to God; and it is a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and muſt be ſlain. And this is remarkable in all theſe, in which though no Death befall us, (as in the Beaſt offered in Sacrifice) but that Death (which is our Life) our death to ſin; yet a change there is, which being made to the honour of Gods Majeſty, is very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and acceptable in his ſight. When we <hi>doe juſtly,</hi> we have ſlain the Beaſt, the worſt part of us, our love of the world, our filthy luſts, our covetouſneſſe and ambition, which are the life and ſoul of fraud, and violence, and oppreſſion, by which they live, and move, and have their being. When we offer up our Goods, there is a change; For how ſtrong is our affection to them? how do we adore them as Gods? are they not in common eſteeme as our life and blood? and do we not as willingly part with our breath as with our wealth? Now he that doth good and diſtribute, he that ſcatters his wealth, poures forth his very blood; binds the ſacrifice with cords to the horns of the Altar, lets out all worldly deſires with his wealth, and hath ſlain that ſacrifice, ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, with which God is well pleaſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And laſt of all, Humility waſts and conſumes us to nothing; makes us an <hi>Holocauſt,</hi> a whole burnt-offering, Nothing in our ſelves, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in reſpect of God; and in htis our Exinanition, exalts all the graces of God in us, fills us with life and glory, with high apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, with lively anticipations of that which is not ſeen, but laid up for us in the Treaſuries of heaven. Theſe are the Good mans ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and they naturally flow from this Good which is here ſhewed in the Text, and are the parts of it. Theſe were from the beginning and ſhall never be aboliſht; and if we offer up theſe, we ſhall never be queſtioned, nor askt, <hi>will God be pleaſed with theſe?</hi> for he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed onely with theſe, and for theſe, with whatſoever we offer; and he will love us for them, and accept us in him, who to ſanctifie and preſent theſe, offered himſelf an offering, <hi>a ſacrifice of a ſweet-ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſavour;</hi> even Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, <hi>who is a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchizedeck.</hi>

Good we deſire, and when our deſires have run to that which we ſet up for good, we meet with nothing but evil, which ſhewes not it ſelf till it be felt; we hoyſe up our ſailes and make towards it, and are ſwallowed up in that <hi>Sea</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls it, of the good things of this world, which we thought mighty carry us to the end of our hope; we take it for bread, and in our mouth 'tis gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell; we took it for pleaſure, and when we taſted it, it was gall; we hunt after riches, as <hi>Good,</hi> and they begger us; climb to honour, and that breaks our neck; and though we ſwallow down theſe good things, as the <hi>Oxe doth water,</hi> yet we are never full. Saint <hi>Hilary</hi> in his comments on the firſt <hi>Pſalme</hi> having obſerved, that ſome there were who drew down all their interpretations of that book reſpectively to ſpirituall things and God himſelf, becauſe they thought it ſome diſparagement to that book, that terrene and ſecular matter ſhould ſo often interline it ſelf; yet paſſeth on them no heavier cenſure then this, <hi>haec corum opinio argui non poteſt,</hi> &amp;c. We need not be ſo ſevere as to condemn this opinion of theirs, becauſe it proceeds from a mind piouſly and Religiouſly affected; and it is a thing which deſerves rather commendation then blame, by a favourable endeavour to ſtrive to apply all things to him by whom all things were made. For theſe things are not <hi>Good,</hi> but onely go under this deputative and borrowed title: The world hath cryed them up, but the ſcripture hath no ſuch name for them; it is <hi>Good</hi> to praiſe the Lord, nay 'tis <hi>Good</hi> to be afflicted, this we read; but where do we read, It is good to be rich; It is good to be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; It is good to go in purple, and fare deliciouſly every day? we find many curſes and woes ſent after them, but we never find them graced with the title of good. <hi>Thou haſt received thy good things,</hi> faith <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Dives;</hi>

It is the delight of man, and it is the delight of Angels, the delight and glory of God himſelf. In reſpect of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it is not materiall, whether we be rich, or poore, naked or clothed, at the mill, or on the throne, <hi>Cenſum non requirit, nudo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine contenta eſt,</hi> religion and piety require nothing but a man, for 'twere ſtrange we ſhould think this <hi>Good</hi> was ſhewed, this Religion ordained to put us to charges.

For indeed it is the property of a rule to be ſo, perſpicuous; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is not a rule, but an <hi>Oracle,</hi> or rather a ſnare to catch us; for how ſhall we be able to embrace it, if we cannot ſee it? how ſhall we be able to do our duty, if we know not what it is? if the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet give an uncertain ſound, who ſhall prepare himſelf to battle? ſaith Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> If this good be clouded with darkneſſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, who ſhall gird up his loynes to make his approches and addreſſes to it? 'tis true indeed; to draw neere, to lay hold and joyne with it (having no better retinue commonly, then contempt and reproch, then miſery and affliction, then perſecution and death, being compaſſed about with theſe terrors,) is a matter of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, in regard of our weakneſſe and frailty, which loves not to look upon beauty in ſuch a dreſſe; and that domeſtick war which is within us, and that fight and contention which is between the fleſh and the ſpirit; and in this reſpect it is a <hi>narrow way,</hi> and we muſt uſe a kind of violence upon our ſelves to work through it to our end; but yet it is ſhewed and manifeſted, and the knowledge of the way is not ſhut up and barricadoed, but to thoſe who are not willing to find it, but run a contrary way by ſome falſe light, which they had rather look upon and follow, then that which leads them <hi>upon the pricks,</hi> upon labour, and ſorrow, and difficulty. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever concernes a <hi>man,</hi> is eaſie to be ſeen, for it is as open as the day, in other paſſages, and diſpenſations of himſelf, in other effects of his power and wiſdome: God is a <hi>God afar off,</hi> but in this which concernes us, he is neere at hand, he is with us, about us, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us; In other things, which will no whit advantage us to ſee, he makes darkneſſe his pavilion round about him, but in this he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playes his beams. <hi>His way is in the whirlwind, Nahum</hi> 1.3. <hi>and his footſteps are not known, Pſ.</hi> 77.19. why he lifts up one on high, and layes another in the duſt; why he now ſhines upon my tabernacle, and anon beats upon it with his tempeſt; why he placeth a man of <hi>Belial</hi> in the throne, and ſets the poore innocent man to grind at the mill; why he paſſeth by a brothel-houſe, and with his thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der beats down his own temple; why he keepeth not a conſtant courſe in his works, but to day paſſeth by us in a ſtill voice, and to morrow in an earthquake; as it is far removed out of our ken and ſight, ſo to know it would not promote or forward us in our moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to happineſſe; we are the wiſer, that we do not know them; for there is no greater folly in the world then for a mortall, finite creature, to diſcover ſuch a mad ambition, as to deſire to know as much, and be as wiſe as his creator. <hi>This was my infirmity,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> I was even ſick, when I did think of it; and he checketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.11. Behold the world is my ſtage, and here I
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:59296:305"/> muſt move by that light which he hath afforded me, and not be put out of my part to a full ſhame, by a bold and unſeaſonable contemplation of Gods proceedings; not run out of my own wayes by gazing too boldly on his. My buſineſſe is to embrace this <hi>good,</hi> and that will be my Angel to keep me in all my wayes, that I daſh not my foot againſt a ſtone, againſt thoſe perplext and croſſe events, which are thoſe ſtones which we ſo hardly digeſt. I cannot know why he lifteth up one, and pulleth down another; but if I cleave to this, This will lift up my head, even when I am down. It is not fit I ſhould know why the wicked proſper; but by this light I ſee a ſerpent in their Paradiſe, which will deceive and ſting them to death: why they proſper I cannot find out, but he that ſeemes to hide himſelf, comes ſo neere me, as to tell me, <hi>Their proſperity ſhall ſlay them. Prov.</hi> 1.32. That their greateſt happineſſe is their greateſt curſe, and if there be an hell on earth, it is better then their heaven. It is not convenient for me to know things to come; <hi>quem mihi, quem tibi ſinem Dii dederint,</hi> what will be my end, and what will be theirs, <hi>to know the number of their dayes</hi> how long they ſhall rage, and I ſuffer; theſe are like the ſecrets of great Princes, and they may undoe us, and therefore they are lockt up from us in the preſcience and boſome of God, and he keeps the key himſelf, and will not ſhew them: <hi>But caſt thy burden upin him,</hi> do thy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, exerciſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Many ſuch que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions have been in agitation, many ſuch inquiries made, and ſome others of another nature, which do not deſerve the name of queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe they cannot be reſolved, or are reſolved with ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle profit; as concerning the ſtate of the dead, which they could not, or would not diſcover, who were raiſed from it; of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of hell fire, when it ſhould be the ſtudy of our whole life to be thoſe <hi>new creatures</hi> who ſhall never know it; of the condition of infants, that dye in the womb; of Gods decrees, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them; of his omnipotency, omniſcience, omnipreſence, which we as boldly ſpeak of, as we do of the <hi>virtues</hi> in <hi>Ariſtotles morals,</hi> as if we did ſee him as he ſees us, and did know him as we are known.

And to know theſe, is to know all that ſhould be known; and did we practice what is eaſie to know, we ſhould not thus trouble our ſelves and others to know what to practice; and as the ancients uſe to ſay, the way to knowledge is eaſie to them who are deſirous to be Good, nor was this light ever hid from thoſe, who did delight to walk by it; <hi>the law is a light</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> and to ſay it is not viſible when 'tis held forth, is to deny it to be a light; for he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhews it, that it may be ſeen.</p>

The love of honor makes the judgment follow it to that pitch and height, which it hath ſet and markt out: The love of money will gloſſe that bleſſing, which our Saviour hath annext to poverty of ſpirit.

                  <p>For concluſion then; let us cleave faſt to this good, and uphold it in its native and proper purity againſt all externall rites, <note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> and empty formalities, and in the next place, againſt all the pomp of the world, againſt that which we call good, when it makes us evil. I am almoſt aſhamed to name this, or make the compariſon; For what is wealth to righteouſneſſe? what is policy to religion? what is earth to heaven? but I know not how men have been ſo vain as to attempt to draw them together, and to ſhut up the world in this good, or rather this good in the world; to call down God from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, not onely to partake of our fleſh, but our infirmities, and ſinnes, and draw down that which is truely good, and make it an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant and auxiliary to that which is truely evil. For how do mens countenance, nay how doth their religion alter, as they ſee or heare how the world doth go? Now they are of this faction, and then of that, and anon of a third: Now <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> anon <hi>Browniſts,</hi> anon <hi>Papiſts,</hi> anon— but I cannot number the many religions, and the no-religions; but whereſoever they faſten, they ſee it, and ſay it is <hi>Good;</hi> ſo that as it was obſerved of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that before the corruption and decay of manners they would not entertain a ſervant or officer but of a perfect and goodly ſhape; but afterwards, when luxury and riot had prevailed, and was in credit with them, they diligently ſought out, and counted it a kind of elegancy and ſtate to take into their retinue dwarfs, and monſters, and men of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious appearance, <hi>ludibria naturae,</hi> thoſe errors and mockeries of nature: So hath it allſo fallen out with Religion, at the firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The world, the world is the mint, where moſt mens religion is coyned; and if you well mark the ſtamp and ſuperſcription, you may ſee the Prince of the ayre on one ſide, and the world on the other; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil on the ſide like an Angel of light, and the world on the other with its pomp and glories: And then when we have brought our deſires home to their ends, when we have raiſed our ſtate and name, how good, how religious are we? when the purſe is full, the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is quiet; when we are laden with earthly bleſſings, we take them as a faire <hi>pledge</hi> of eternall: we ſay to our ſelves as <hi>Michah</hi> did, <hi>Judges</hi> 17.13. <hi>Now I know that the Lord will do me good, becauſe I have a Prieſt,</hi> ſaid he; becauſe we have great poſſeſſions, ſay we, as great <hi>Idolaters</hi> as <hi>Micah,</hi> for what are our ſhekels of ſilver, but as his graven and molten image? and thus we walk on ſecurely all the dayes of our life, not as the children of this world, but as the <hi>children of light,</hi> and out of our great abundance ſometimes drop a penny; we waſt away, and ſicken, and make our will, and ſeale it, and doubt not, but the ſpirit will do his office and ſeale our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: at laſt the rich man dyes, and is buried, and ſome hireling will tell you, The Angels have carried his ſoul into heaven: A ſtrange conceit, and if true, would be of force to pluck <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, and to bring back <hi>Dives</hi> through the gulph, and place him in his roome.</p>
                  <p>But if this be not true, may it never be true: onely let us not deceive our ſelves, but ſearch and try our hearts, and root out all ſuch vain, ſuch groundleſſe, ſuch pernicious imaginations, which may be raiſed up in time of proſperity, and multiply like flyes in the

                     <hi>Run to and fro through the ſtreets of Jeruſalem, and ſee of you can find a</hi> MAN, and he is the ſpectator, and cannot but ſee it. <hi>But what went you out into the wilderneſſe to ſee?</hi> ſaith our Saviour; <hi>why the eye is never ſatisfyed,</hi> and all would go out to ſee; ſome would ſee ſoft raiment, and that you may ſee on every back; ſome gaze upon beauty, and thats a burning-glaſſe to ſet the ſoul on fire. Others love to ſee the redneſſe of the wine; <hi>look not on it,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, It is a mocker.</hi> Some would behold a ſhew of pomp and glory, and we ſee, though juſtice can never faile, but hath the beſt, even when ſhe is worſted, yet injuſtice hath had more triumphs then ſhe.

But the eye with which we behold theſe ſpectacles is not fit for this object; we have another eye, a ſpirituall eye, we call it the eye of our reaſon, and we call it the <hi>eye of our faith,</hi> which many times is but as an eye of glaſſe for ſhew, but no uſe at all, and ſerves to hide a deformity, but not to ſee with; but if it be a quick and living eye, then here is a fit object for it, worth the looking on, in which we may ſee all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things in a fairer dreſſe, in a celeſtiall forme, in the Beauty of Holineſſe, being made uſefull and ſubſervient to it, like that <hi>Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Trinitatis,</hi> that feigned Glaſſe, in which (they tell us) he that looks, ſees all things.

I ſay, there is a degree of infidelity in all theſe averſions from this good; all that can be ſaid is but what many ſay within themſelves after they have conſulted with fleſh and blood, that this good is not ſhewn ſo clearly, nor made ſo plain, as it is ſaid to be, which is indeed to remove their own prop and pillar, to demoliſh their own Idol, and to drive faith quite out of the world: believe they do in God, yet will not truſt him; and they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the truth of things not ſeen, yet will leave the purſuit of them, to follow vanity, becauſe they are not ſeen. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good,</hi> and wilt thou not believe him? <hi>fath is the ſubſtance of things not ſeen,</hi> and though they be not ſeen, yet they are evident, the <hi>Meanes</hi> evident, and the <hi>End</hi> as evident as the <hi>Meanes;</hi> In our ſad and ſober thoughts, when we talk like ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive men, as evident as what is open to the eye. But ſuch an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we have, which a covetous man would ſoon, lay hold on for a title to a faire inheritance; and the ambitious for an aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome great place: for if ſuch a record had been tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to poſterity, if the Scripture which conveighs this <hi>Good,</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed ſome rich Mannor or Lordſhip upon them, it ſhould have then found an eaſie belief, and been Goſpel, <hi>a ſure word of prophecy,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable, undoubtable, like the decrees of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> which muſt ſtand faſt for ever and cannot be altered; for too many there be who had rather have their names in a good leaf, then in the book of life; and this is the reaſon why we are ſo ignorant of that which is good indeed, and ſo great clerks in that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted good, but by the worſt; why we are ſo dull and indocile in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending that wiſdome, which is from above, and ſo wiſe and witty to our own damnation; why we do but darkly ſee this <hi>Good</hi> which is ſo plainly ſhewed unto us.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall we ſay then? nay, what ſaith the Scripture? <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt</hi> in ſloth and idleneſſe; thou that ſleepeſt in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, in the midſt of thy unruly and turbulent paſſions; ariſe from the grave and ſepulchre wherein thy ſloth hath intomb'd thee; ariſe from the dead, from that naſty charnel-houſe of rotten bones, where ſo many vitious habits have ſhut thee up; break up thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument, caſt aſide <hi>every weight,</hi> and every ſinne, that <hi>preſſeth

We may imagine, that a Law is a meer indication of power, that it proceeds from Rigor, and Severity; that there is nothing commanded, nothing required, but there is <hi>Smoke,</hi> and <hi>Thunder,</hi> and <hi>Lightning;</hi> but indeed every Law of God is the Naturall and proper effect and Iſſue of his Love; from his power, 'tis true; but his power mannaged and ſhewn in Wiſdome and Love; For he made us to this End, and to this End he requires ſomething of us; not out of any Indigency, as if he wanted our Company and Service, (for he was as Happy before the Creation, as after) but to have ſome object for his Love and Goodneſſe to work upon; to have an Exceptory, and veſſel for the dew of Heaven to fall into; as the Jews were wont to ſay, <hi>Propter Meſsiam mundum fuiſſe conditum,</hi> That the world and all mankind were made for the Meſſias, whoſe buſineſſe was to <hi>preach the Law which his Father ſaid unto him,</hi>

                  <p>And in this Conſiſts the perfection and Beauty of Man; for the perfection of Every Thing is its drawing neere to its firſt principle and Originall; and the neerer and liker a thing is to the firſt cauſe that produced it, the more perfect it is as the Heat is moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which is moſt intenſe, and hath moſt of the Fire in it. And Man the more he partakes of that which is Truly <hi>Good,</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, of which his ſoul is as it were a ſparkle, the more perfect he is, becauſe this was the onely End for which God made him; This was the End of all his Lawes, that he might find juſt Cauſe to do him Good; That man might draw neere to him here by Obedience, and Conformity to his will, and in the world to come reign with him for ever in Glory. And as it is the perfection, ſo is it the Beauty of a man: for, as there is the Beauty of the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4. ſo is there the beauty of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: The Beauty of the Lord is to have will, and power, and

Beauty is nothing elſe but a reſult from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; the beauty of the Body proceeding from the ſymmetrie and due proportion of parts, and the beauty of the Soule from the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of the will and affections to the will and law of God.

For ſo we find Interrogations to be fitted, and ſharpned like darts, and then ſent towards them who could not be awaked with leſſe noyſe, nor leſſer ſmart: and we find them of diverſe ſhapes and Faſhions. Sometimes they come as complaints, <hi>why do the Heathen rage? Pſ.</hi> 2.1. Sometimes as upbraidings, <hi>How cameſt thou in hither? Math.</hi> 22. Sometimes as Admonitions; <hi>why ſhould I now kill thee?</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. Sometimes as Reproofs, <hi>why tempt ye me, you Hypocrites?</hi> and whitherſoever they fly, they are Feathered and pointed with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for there is no reaſon why that ſhould be done, of which Chriſt asks a reaſon, why it is done?

Nay this was their delight, this they doted on, and this they thought none could cry down, but a falſe Prophet. Did they not thus ſpeak and murmur within themſelves, If this be not, what is then Religion? If to appeare in his Courts, to offer Sacrifice, be not to ſerve God, how ſhould we bowe before him and ſerve him? as many ſay in their hearts now adayes; If to goe to Church, to be zealous in a Faction, to cry down Superſtition, be not true Religion, what Religion can there be? Who can ſpeak againſt it but an uncircumciſed Philiſtim, or he that hath drunk deep of the Cup of the Whore? He that preacheth any other Law, or any other Goſpel, let him be <hi>Anathema.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prophet to ſilence this, asks another queſtion; Do you ask, if this be not, what is true Religion? I ask alſo, <hi>What doth the Lord require?</hi> Not this in which you pleaſe your ſelves, <hi>But</hi> ſomething elſe; <hi>But, to doe juſtly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.</hi>

For, commonly, thoſe duties which require the luctation of the mind, the ſtrivings and victories of the Spirit, are more formidable, and ſo more avoided, then thoſe which imploy onely the outward man, the Eye, the Tongue, the Eare, and the Hand: Here every man is ready and officious, and thruſts himſelf into the ſervice; every man almoſt, rejoyceth to run his race, and there is a kind of emulation and contention, who ſhall be the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeſt; but thoſe commands which ſet us at variance within our ſelves, which buſie the Spirit againſt the Fleſh; which ſound the Allarm, and call us into the liſts to fight the good fight of Faith againſt our ſelves, againſt our Imaginations, even thoſe which lye unto us, and tell us <hi>All is well:</hi> Theſe are that <hi>Meduſa</hi>'s head, which turns us into ſtones; and we who were ſo active and diligent in other duties leſſe neceſſary, when theſe call upon us to move, are lame, and impotent; we who before had the feet of Hinds, can move no more then he did who lay ſo long by the pool ſide.

'Tis true, God hath now concluded all under ſinne, and the reaſon is given, <hi>For all have ſinned, Rom.</hi> 3.23. but the Apoſtle there delivers it as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and matter of Fact, not as a Concluſion drawn out of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary principles; be doth not ſay <hi>All muſt ſinne,</hi> but <hi>All have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:</hi> for, both the Gentiles might have kept the Law of Nature, and were puniſht becauſe they did not, as it is plain in the firſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter; and the Jews might have kept that Law which was given to them, as far as God required it; for ſo we ſee many of them did, and God himſelf bore witneſſe from heaven, and hath regiſtred the names of thoſe in his book, <hi>who did walk before him with a perfect heart,</hi> as of <hi>Aza,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. of <hi>David, that he kept Gods Lawes,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11. of <hi>Joſias, that he turned not aſide neither to the right

<pb n="515" facs="tcp:59296:317"/> the Law cannot be kept neither without the Help of Grace, nor with it; and ſo it muſt loſe its name; nor is it a Law; for what Law is that which cannot be kept? I know it was a Decree of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill at Carthage, <hi>That every man ought to pray to God to forgive him his Treſpaſſes: That he ought to ſpeak it, not as out of Humility, but Truly;</hi> and I think there are ſcarce any, that will not willingly ſubſcribe to it, and this Decree may be as unchangeable as thoſe of the Medes and Perſians: But yet I do not ſee any Neceſſity of fixing this doctrine, of the Impoſſibility of Doing what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, on the Gates of the Temple, or proclaiming it as by the ſound of the Trumpet, in the midſt of the Great Congregation. For this Petition is put up in eſpeciall Relation to ſinnes paſt, for <hi>Ne peccemus,</hi> is in order before <hi>ſi peccemus,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1. we are firſt commanded not to ſinne, and then follows the ſuppoſition, <hi>if we ſinne:</hi> ſo that theſe two, <hi>ſinne not,</hi> and <hi>if you ſinne,</hi> make up this Concluſion, we may, or we may not ſinne, rather then this, It is impoſſible to keep to Laws. So then, This petition may be ſaid, <hi>Humiliter,</hi> humbly, and <hi>veraciter,</hi> truly, in reſpect of ſinnes paſt; but it is neither Truth nor Humility to make God a Liar; to call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to do that, which he requires, when he knows we cannot do it; to make him a Tyrant, in cripling us firſt, and then ſending us about his buſineſſe; In giving us fleſh which the ſpirit cannot Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer; in letting looſe that Lion upon us, which we cannot reſiſt; in leaving us naked to thoſe Temptations which we cannot ſubdue.

For he knows of whom he requires it, even of men, and he conſiders us as men, and <hi>remembers whereof we are made:</hi> He doth not require we ſhould be as Juſt and Mercifull as he is; God may give us his ſtrength, but he cannot give us his Arm; to be as Juſt as he; This is more impoſſible then that which is moſt impoſſible, it is impoſſible to think it; nor doth he look that our Obedience ſhould be as exact as that of the Angels, <hi>quorum immortalitas ſine ullo malorum metu &amp; periculo conſtat,</hi> whoſe Happineſſe is removed from all danger, or Feare of change, ſaith <hi>Lactantius;</hi> but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an Obedience anſwerable to our Condition, which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt both with ſin and Error, into which man, as <hi>man</hi> may ſometimes either through inadvertency, or frailty fall into, and yet do what he requires: But then, If this Doctrine were true, That we were Fettered &amp; ſhackled with an impoſſibility of doing what he requires, as indeed it hath neither Reaſon nor Scripture to countenance
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:59296:318"/> it, yet ſure it cannot without danger be ſo rudely, and with ſuch zeal and earneſtneſſe publiſht, as ſometimes it is; nor can it ſavour of that ſpirituall wiſdome, which is the <hi>Salt</hi> which every Teacher ſhould have in himſelf, to urge and preſſe it to the multitude, who are too ready to make an Idoll of that ſerpent which is lifted up to cure them. For how many weak hands, and feeb e knees, and cowardly Hearts hath this made? How willing are we to heare of weakneſſe, and impoſſibilities, becauſe we would not keep the Law? How oft do we lye down with this Thought, and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or rather runne away with it even againſt the Law it ſelf, and break it? what polluted, blind, impotent, cripled wretches are we ready to call our ſelves? which were indeed a Glorious confeſſion, were it made out of hatred to ſinne; but moſt commonly they are ſent forth not from a broken, but a hollow heart; and comfort us rather then accuſe us; are rather flatteries then aggravations; the oyl of ſinners, to break their heads, to infatuate them; not to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple their limbs, but benum them; and they beget no other Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in us, but this, Not to gird up our loines, becauſe we are weak; to ſinne more and more, becauſe we cannot but ſinne; not to do what God requires, becauſe we have already concluded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our ſelves, that it is impoſſible. To conclude this; The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not whether we can exactly keep a Law, ſo as not to faile ſometimes as men; for I know no reaſon why this queſtion ſhould be put up; but whether we can keep it ſo far forth as God requires, and in his goodneſſe will accept; whether we can be <hi>Juſt,</hi> and <hi>Mercifull,</hi> and <hi>Humble</hi> men? and if this be impoſſible, then will follow as ſad an impoſſibility of being ſaved; For the not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he requires, is that alone which ſhuts the Gates of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt us, and cuts of all hope of eternall happineſſe: and this were to unpeople Heaven; this were a dragons taile to draw down all the ſtarrs, and caſt them into hell. But the Saints are ſealed, and have this ſeal, that they did what God required, and it is a thing ſo far from being impoſſible, that the Prophet makes but a <hi>But</hi> of it; It is not impoſſible, it is <hi>but to do juſtly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with our God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For ſecondly, It is ſo far from being impoſſible, that it is but an eaſie duty. <hi>My yoke is eaſie,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. and <hi>my bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den light:</hi> For 'tis fitted to our necks and ſhoulders, and is ſo far from taking from our nature, or preſſing it with violence, that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts and perfects it. All is in putting it about our necks, and then this yoke is an ornament of Grace, as <hi>Solomons</hi> chain about them; and when this burden is layed on, then 'tis not a burden, but our form to quicken us, and our Angel to guide us with delight in all our waies. And this the beloved diſciple ſuckt from his maſters boſome, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. <hi>This is the love of God, that we keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:59296:318"/> and his commandments are not grievous;</hi> for here is love and hope to ſweeten them, and make them eaſie and pleaſant. Nor doth he ſpeak this as an orator, to take them by craft, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them that that which he exhorted them to, was neither impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, nor difficult, and ſo give force to his exhortation, and make a way for it to enter, and work a full perſwaſion in them to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to thoſe commands; but as a Logician, he backs and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes his affirmation with an undeniable reaſon in the next verſe, <hi>For whatſoever is bern of God overcometh the world,</hi> and ſo his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments are not grievous to thoſe who have the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God: He that is born of God muſt needs have ſtrength enough to paſſe through all hinderances whatſoever, to tread down all Principalities, and Powers, to demoliſh all imaginations, which ſet up and oppoſe themſelves, and ſo make theſe commands more grievous, then they are in their own nature; and this he ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens with another reaſon in the next verſe, <hi>For he that is born of God,</hi> hath the help and advantage of faith, and full perſwaſion of the power of Jeſus Chriſt, which is <hi>that victory which overcometh the world;</hi> ſo that whoſoever ſaith the commandments are grievous, with the ſame breath excommunicates himſelf from the Church of Chriſt, and makes himſelf an Hypocrite, and pofeſſes he is that which he is not, a Chriſtian, when Chriſts words are irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and tedious unto him; That he is born of God, when he hath neither the language nor the motion of a child of God; doth not what God requires, but doth the works of another father, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.

But the doing what God requires, our conformity to his will is the onely baſis upon which ſuch a ſuperſtructure will riſe, and towre up as high as heaven, for it hath the will and power of God to uphold and perpetuate it, againſt all thoſe ſtormes and tempeſts which are ſent out of the devils treaſury to blaſt or imbitter it. Do you take this for a ſpeculation and no more? Indeed it is the ſin and the puniſhment of the men of this world to take thoſe truths which
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:59296:319"/> moſt concern them, for ſpeculations, for the groundleſſe concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoughtfull men, for ſchool ſubtilties, rather then realities: <hi>Mammon</hi> and the world have the preeminence in all things, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall raviſhments and heaven it ſelf are but <hi>ingens fabula, &amp; magnum mendacium,</hi> as a tedious ly, or a long tale that is told. And there is no reaſon of this, but their diſobedience; for would they put it to the triall, deny themſelves and cleave to the Lord, and do what he deſires, there would then be no need of any Artiſt, or Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue to demonſtrate it, or fill their mouth with arguments to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of the truth of that which would ſo fill their ſouls. Of all the Saints and Martyrs of God that did put it to the triall, did we ever read that any did complain that they had loſt their labour? but upon a certain knowledge and ſenſe of this truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themſelves cheerfully to the hardſhip of mortification, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the world, and laid down their lives; poured out their blood for that truth, which paid them back again with intereſt, even with fulneſſe of joy. Let us then hearken what this Lord will ſay, and anſwer him in every duty which he requires, and he will anſwer us again, and appeare in glory, and make the terrours and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of the world, the object not of our feare and amazement, but contempt; and the diſpleaſing and worſer ſide of our obedience, our Crown and Glory, the moſt delightfull thing in the world; for (to conclude this) why are we afraid? why ſhould we tremble at the commands of God? why ſhould their ſound be ſo terrible in our eares? The Lord requires nothing of us, but that which firſt is poſſible, to rouſe us up to attempt it; ſecondly, which is eaſie, to comfort and nouriſh our hopes; and thirdly, which is pleaſant and delightfull to do, to woe and invite, and even flatter us to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to draw us after him <hi>with the cords of men. And what doth he require, but to do juſtly, and love mercy?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>We have now taken a view of the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of theſe words, <note place="margin">The Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</note> and we have looked upon them in the <hi>form and manner</hi> in which they lye; <hi>what doth the Lord require?</hi> let us now draw them neerer to us; for to this end they are ſharpned into an interrogation, that as darts they might pierce through our ſouls, and ſo open our eyes to ſee, and our eares to hearken to the <hi>wonders of his Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And firſt; this word <hi>Lord</hi> is a word of force and efficacy, and ſtrikes a reverence in us, and remembers us of our duty and allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; for if he be the Lord, then hath he an abſolute will, a will which muſt be a rule to regulate our wills by his <hi>Jubeo</hi> and his <hi>vete,</hi> by his commands and prohibitions; by removing our wills from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull objects, and confining them to that which may improve and perfect them; from that which is pleaſing but hurtfull, to his Laws and commands, which are firſt diſtaſtfull, and then fill them
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:59296:320"/> with joy unſpeakable. And this is the true mark and character of a ſervant of God, to be then willing, when in a manner he is unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; to be ſtrong when the fleſh is weak; to have no will of his own, nor any other ſpring of ſpirituall motion, but the will of his <hi>Lord.</hi> And therefore as he is the Lord over all, ſo are his Laws over all Laws; as to him every knee muſt bowe, ſo to his Laws all the Laws of men muſt yield and give place, which are no further Laws, or can lay any tye or obligation, but as they are drawn from his, and wait upon them, and are ſubſervient to them; common reaſon will tell us, and to that the Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> appeal, when the rulers of the Jews commanded them to ſpeak no more in the name of Chriſt, <note place="margin">Act. 4.18,19.</note> 
                     <hi>whether it be right in the ſight of God to hearken unto you more then to God, judge you; for we cannot but ſpeak the things which we have ſeen and heard,</hi> and we cannot but be obedient, for the Lord requires it. When <hi>Creon</hi> the Tyrant in <hi>Euripides</hi> ask'd <hi>Antigone,</hi> how ſhe dared to bury her brother <hi>Polynices,</hi> when he had enacted a Law to the contrary, her anſwer was <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

                     </gap>, for this Law was not of yeſterday, but eternall, and I ought not for feare of any man to break the Law of God and nature. And what better anſwer can a Chriſtian make to all unlawfull commands, either of thoſe we love, or of thoſe we feare? <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. God hath not enacted theſe, I ſee more of the claw of the devil, then finger of God in theſe; theſe are <hi>Novellae inſtitutionis,</hi> but of yeſterday; the breathings, and dictates, it may be, of Luſt and Covetouſneſſe, of Pride and Ambition, and I muſt not conſider what man, what this man, this Lord or this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate, but what the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings requires at my hands; when his Laws are publiſht, all others muſt be ſilent, or as little hearkened to, as if they were; as when the Sun appeares the ſtarrs are not ſeen, nor ſeen at any time, but with that light which they borrow from it.</p>
                  <p>For again, as he is Lord Paramount, and hath an abſolute will, ſo his will is attended with Power, with that Power, which made thee; and he did not make thee a man, that thou ſhouldeſt make thy ſelf a beaſt of burden, to couch under every load which the hand of a Phariſee will be ready to lay upon thee; He did not make thee capable of a Law, that thou ſhouldeſt keep the Laws of the fleſh, or of men; he did not publiſh his will, that upon this or that pretence thou ſhouldeſt reſiſt it; that the feare of a frown, and the love of the world ſhould be ſtronger, and prevaile with thee more then his will. For if thou wilt not do what he requires, he will not do what thou expecteſt, but leave thee to thy choice, to thoſe new Lords and Maſters under the ſame wrath and curſe to
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:59296:320"/> walk delicately along with them to that vengeance, which will fall upon the heads of thoſe who will not hearken to this Lord.</p>
                  <p>For thirdly, by the ſame power he preſerves and protects thee, which all power that is over us doth not; for then the theef may be ſaid to protect him he robs; the ſtrong; man may be ſaid to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect him he binds; the oppreſſor him whom he hath eaten up; and <hi>Cain</hi> to have protected <hi>Abel,</hi> when he knockt out his brains: But the Power of God is a ſaving and preſerving power, and under the ſhadow of his wing we ſhall be ſafe; and to this end he ſpreads his wing over us, he guides and holds us up, that we may walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in all obedience, in the land of the living; who bowing to his will againſt our luſt, anon againſt our Ambition, againſt all thoſe machinations and temptations, which preſſe upon us to break his will, even whilſt we are under his wing. What ſhould a wanton, what ſhould an oppreſſor, a man of <hi>Belial</hi> do under his wing? And yet we ſee many times they play and revell it in the ſhadow, when they that do his will are beaten with the tempeſt, and yet are ſafer there then they are in their Paradiſe; are the miracles of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to be manifeſted at laſt to all the world. 'Tis true, The wicked are in ſome ſort under his wing, for he upholds, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues them, prolongs their daies; and if an eye of fleſh may judge, they are the greateſt favourites of this Lord; and if the world were heaven, they were the onely Saints: <hi>But the ſpirituall man judgeth all things,</hi> and to his eye they are but a ſad and ruefull ſpectacle, as condemned men led with muſick to execution; for he preſerves and protects them no otherwiſe then he doth ſerpents, and vipers, and beaſts of prey; he upholds them no otherwiſe then he doth the earth, and the devils, and hell it ſelf, which he preſerves for them, as he reſerves them for it, as Saint <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks in his Epiſtle, v. 5. and then as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to the rich man, <hi>Son, Remember, thou in thy life time receivedſt thy good things;</hi> ſo ſhall this Lord to theſe, to a <hi>Cain,</hi> to a <hi>Nimrod,</hi> an <hi>Ahab,</hi> an <hi>Phariſee,</hi> a <hi>Hypocrite;</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you were under my wing, under my protection, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what you did there, how you beat your fellow-ſervants, how you ſtripped one, diſpoſſeſſed another, killed a third; how even then when you were under my wing, when I upheld and preſerved you, you ſaid in your hearts, <hi>there was no God.</hi> This is a fearefull and hideous change, like the fall of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> onely he fell from heaven indeed, theſe from an Imaginary one, a heaven built up with a thought; but both fall into the ſame place. O then ſince he made us, ſince in him we live, and move, and have our being, let us live unto this Lord, let our motion be regular; and let us be what he would have us be; let it be our wiſdome to follow him in thoſe waies which his infinite wiſdome hath drawn out for us; let our love be the echo of his love; this wiſdom is from above, and this
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:59296:321"/> love is kindled from the coal of a cherubin, is a fire from heaven kindled in our hearts, and it will lick up all fluid and unbounded de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires in us. Let us remember, that he hath endowed us with facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ability to do what he requires; that he hath committed and entruſted this unto us for this end, that he doth now, as it were, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu ſuâ tenere debitores,</hi> that he hath us in his power, obliged and bound faſt unto him by this his gift, as by an inſtrument or bond; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

Let us remember then, that we come under many obligations; I cannot name the ſeverall waies we ſtand obliged to this Lord; we may comprehend all in that axiome of the <hi>Civilians, Tot obligationes preſumuntur quot ſunt ſcripturae,</hi> we have as many engagements and obligations, as there be inſtruments and writings betwixt us; and there are as many, as there be precepts and commands, which are the beſt helps to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote us to perfection. Let us then provide againſt the day of triall; for not to keep covenant with him, but when he comes to make inquiſition whether we have done what he required, to preſent him with nothing but ſhews, but good intentions, but drowſie endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and feeble wiſhes; when he comes to ask for his talent to ſhew him a napkin, is a plain forfeiture of our obligation, and brings us under a worſe and heavier, binds us over to puniſhment. Let us then ever fix our eye upon onr obligation; let us conſider that he made us, that he upheld and protected us, and ſo had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to oblige us and bind us to him by a Law; let us admire his wiſdome, and embrace his love; let this double chain, the ſtrong Iron chain of his infinite power and univerſall dominion; the glorious and golden thain of his ſuperabundant love, bind and tye us unto him; and when all other creatures are ready to bowe at Gods beck, and follow conſtantly in that way which nature hath allotted them, and do ſeldome or never turn aſide; when the Sun knows his ſetting, and the Moone her ſeaſons, let not us forget our ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and place, but anſwer this Lord in every command, as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Centurions did their Emperours, <hi>Factum eſt, Imperator, quod juſsiſti;</hi> Behold thou art our Lord, and we have done what thou requireſt.</p>

For how do we every day make a ſurrendry of our wills to thoſe who have will indeed, and proclaim their will, but have neither might, nor wiſdome, nor love to attend it? <hi>Ibo, licèt invita faciam omnia,</hi> ſaith the woman in the Comedy; <note place="margin">Plaut.

To riſe up early and lye down late are nothing pleaſing to us, yet for that which a wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man contemns, for a little pelf, we will do it. To wait attendance, to bowe, and crings, and make great men Gods, to give him a leg, whom we wiſh on the gallowes, to engage our ſelves for the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt task, to be diminiſhed and brought low, to ſweat, and fight, and dye, cannot be delightfull to fleſh and blood, yet for honour we will do it. But then how do we debauch our underſtandings and wits, and bury them in other mens wills as in a Sepnlchre, there to rot and ſtink amidſt thoſe corrupt and loathſome imaginations, which are as wings to carry them to their unwarrantable ends? how ready are we to conclude that to be true, which we know to be falſe, that to be lawfull, which our conſcience condemns? It was a ſinne, It is now a duty; It was as abomination, it is now a ſign of <hi>Election;</hi> It was oppreſſion, Power hath ſet a mark upon the innocent, and it is juſtice; It was an Idol, 'tis now our God; It was a devil, a black and ugly fiend, 'tis now an Angel of light.

I have much wondered, that men ſhould be ſo willing to publiſh their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and diſability in this, and in other things to hide and maſque it as they do their ſinne; that they ſhould be ready to brand him with the name of Heretick, that ſhall tell them, they may be Juſt and Honeſt men, if they will; that God will aſſiſt them, if they put him not from them; and yet be as forward to be <hi>Paraſites</hi> to that <hi>Paraſite,</hi> and reward him that ſhall commend their prudence, and dextrous activity in the affaires of this world, as if they were made for this world, and no other, and made able to raiſe a bank here, but not to lay up for themſelves any treaſure in heaven. <hi>Why ſhould it be thought a thing incredible, that God ſhould raiſe the dead?</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 26. why ſhould any man think it impoſſible to do the will of God? <hi>It is eaſier for a Camel to go through the eye of a needle, then for a rich man to enter into the kingdome of heaven:</hi> True, whileſt he truſts in his riches.

Our Saviour hath fully determined that, <hi>That with men it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but with God all things are poſsible, Matth.</hi> 19.26. poſſible for him in the barrenneſt ground to plant and gather ſruit; out of any crooked piece of wood to make a Mercury, a ſtatue for himſelf: and this comnipotency of God is referred not onely to the giving a being to all things, but in fitting thoſe helps and furtherances of Piety, which may enable and promote us in the performance of our duty, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth me;</hi> who if we call upon him with that ſincere fervour and humility, which our weakneſſe and his Majeſty requires, is ready at hand; ready by his power and aſſiſtance, to preſerve the rich ſafe from the contagion of wealth, and the ſnare of the devil; and to purge the unclean perſon, and to keep him from <hi>the fooliſh woman,</hi> and the doore of her houſe. Why, why ſhouldeſt thou lay ſo unjuſt an imputation upon ſo juſt and mercifull a Lord? God is not as man, that he ſhould lye; God is not as man, that he ſhould bid us do what we cannot do.

It may ſo fall out, and doth too often, that they who are the beſt artiſts in theſe, are the worſt of men; For the wiſdome of this world is not like that in <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which reſts in it ſelf, and never ſeeks an other end, but in this the theory and the practice goe hand in hand, and advance one another: nor do we make uſe of it onely to preſerve and defend our ſelves, but we let it out to diſquiet and diminiſh others; and they that tread theſe hidden and indirect wayes, though they hide themſelves from others, yet ſeldome do they ſo far deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as not to know they walk deceitfully: for they check, and comfort themſelves at once; they know they do not juſtly, and yet this thought ſets them forward in their courſe, even this poor and unworthy thought, that It is good to be rich; and ſo the light which they ſee is ſomewhat offenſive, but the love of gain is both a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocative, and a cordiall.</p>
                  <p>We will therefore bring <hi>Juſtice to the line,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſſe to the plummet,</hi> and have recourſe to the Law and the Prophets; not ſtand gazing upon the practice of the world, and actions of men, but look upon the rule, by which a diligent eye may eaſily diſcover all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſwervings and deviations, though they be as many as the Atomes before the Sun: For as <hi>Seneca</hi> well, <hi>Difficile eſt animam ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am effugere,</hi> It is a hard matter for a man to fly from himſelf, or to diveſt himſelf of thoſe principles with which he was born, or ſo to fling them from him, as that they ſhall never return to reſtrain and curb him, or at leaſt to moleſt him when his fleſh and luſts are wanton, and unruly, and violent to break their bounds. And now, what doth <hi>the Lord require But to do juſtly?</hi> That is, but to do that, which firſt, the Law of nature requires; ſecondly, that which he at ſundry times by holy men, and his Prophets hath taught, and in the laſt daies hath urged and improved by his Son Chriſt Jeſus, the Prince of Peace and righteouſneſſe. So that Juſtice doth raiſe it ſelf upon theſe two pillars, <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> which are like the two pillars in the porch of the Temple, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.20. <hi>Jachin</hi> and <hi>Boaz,</hi> and do ſtrengthen and eſtabliſh Juſtice, as that doth the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the earth, or as the legs of the bridegroome in the <hi>Canticles</hi> 5.15. <hi>which were as pillars of marble ſet upon ſockets of pure gold:</hi> for the wiſdome and ſtrength of Chriſt and Chriſtianity conſiſts in the adorning and improving of Nature, and ſettling a true and perfect Religion, and the ſockets, the baſes are of pure gold, <hi>Baſis aurea

                  <p>And firſt, Nature it ſelfe hath hewn and ſquared all Mankind as it were out of the ſame Quarry and Rock; hath built them up out of the ſame Materials, into a Body and Society, into a City com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact within it ſelf: For the whole world is but as one City, and all the men therein, in reſpect of mutuall offices of love, are but of one Corporation. <hi>Reſpicite zur.

From the ſame rock are hewed out the weak and feeble man, and <hi>Iſh</hi> the man of ſtrength, who hath <hi>milk in his breaſts, and marrow in his bones;</hi> From the ſame hand is that face we turne away from, and that face we ſo much gaze on; the ſcribe and the Idiot, the narrow underſtanding that receives little, and the active and piercing wit, which runs to and fro the earth; that plain ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple man that hath no ends, and the ſubtile Politician, who multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies his every day, and can compaſſe them all. Of the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction are the purple Gallant, and the <hi>Ruſſet Pilgrime;</hi> and he that made them caſts an equall eye on them all, and binds every hand from violence, and every heart from forging deceit; makes every man a guard and protection to every man; gives every man a guard and conduct for himſelf and others; and to every man the word is given, <hi>touch not another,</hi> and <hi>do him no harm.</hi> Thus hath he fenced us
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:59296:327"/> in and taken care, that the ſtrong man bind not the weak; that the ſcribe over-reach not the Ideot; that the Politician ſupplant not the innocent; that the experienced man defraud not the ignorant; but that every mans ſtrength, and wit, and experience, and wiſdome ſhould be advantageous, and not hurtfull to others; that ſo the weak man may be ſtrong with another mans ſtrength; and the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant man wiſe with anothers experience; and the Ideot be ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the wiſdome of the Scribe. <hi>For who hath made all theſe? have not I the Lord?</hi> and then if he made them, and linkt them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one common tye of nature, <hi>quis diſcernet?</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>who ſhall divide and ſeparate them?</hi> who ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the rich and the poore, that he ſhould ſet him at his footſtool and deſpiſe him? The ſtrong from the weak, that he ſhould beat him to the ground? The wiſe from the ignorant, that he ſhould baſſie and deceive him? Indeed ſme diſtance, ſome difference, ſome precedency of one before the other may ſhew it ſelf to an eye of fleſh; but yet even an eye of fleſh may ſee how to reunite and gather them together as on and the ſame in their Originall: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicite zur,</hi> Look unto the rock, the vein out of which you were taken, and then what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when they ſtrove together, may be ſpoken to all the men in the world, <hi>Sirs, you are brethren,</hi> why do you defraud, or uſe violence? <hi>why do you wrong one to another? Acts</hi> 7.26</p>
                  <p>But in the next place; Beſides this our common extraction, the God of Nature, who hath built us out of the ſame materialls, hath alſo imprinted thoſe Principles, thoſe Notions, thoſe Inclinations in the heart of every man, which may be as ſo many Buttreſſes and ſupporters to uphold this frame, and to make us dwell together in all ſimplicity and innocency of coverſation; not in envy and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, in fraud and deceit, but with courteſie and affability, helping and ſupporting one another, which is that juſtice which God requires at our hands: <hi>Nulla anima ſine crimine, quia nulla ſine Boni ſemine,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian,</hi> No ſoul can plead Not guilty here, becauſe no ſoul is deſtitute of this ſeed of Goodneſſe. And thus we ſee in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. where Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes up that catalogue of foul irregularities, he drags the <hi>unrighteous,</hi> the <hi>covetous,</hi> the <hi>malicious,</hi> the <hi>deceitfull,</hi> the <hi>inventors of evil things,</hi> the <hi>Covenant-breakers,</hi> to no other Tribunal then that of Nature, and condemns them by no other Law then that which we brought with us into the world. <hi>Quaedam jura non ſcripta, ſed omnibus ſcriptis certiora,</hi> ſaith the Orator.

And one would think that it were as ſuperfluous and needleſſe to make any other Law to bind us to Juſtice and upright dealing one towards another, as to command
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:59296:327"/> children to love their parents, or parents to be indulgent to their children: For why ſhould that be urged with that vehemency, to which mens naturall bend and inclination carries them, and would certainly continue them, and hold them up in an even courſe of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and honeſty, did not Education, and their familiar converſe and dalliance with the world, corrupt and blind them? To this Law of Nature S. <hi>James</hi> ſeems to call us back, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.9. where he makes it as a ſtrange thing to be wondred at, That <hi>the ſame tongue that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God, ſhould yet curſe men, who are made after the ſimilitude of God.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>Curſe him not, deceive him not;</hi> for if thou curſe him, if thou deceive him, thou <hi>curſeſt</hi> and <hi>deceiveſt God,</hi> after whoſe ſimilitude he is made. <hi>My brethren, theſe things ought not be,</hi> and are as much againſt nature, as for <hi>the ſame fountain to ſend forth ſweet and bitter water,</hi> or for a <hi>fig-tree</hi> to beare <hi>olives,</hi> or a <hi>vine figs,</hi> at the 12. <hi>ver.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 4. to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> ſhuts up the Lyars mouth with the ſame argument, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. <hi>Wherefore caſt off ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſpeak truth every one to his neighbour:</hi> and the Reaſon follows, <hi>For you are members one of another.</hi> Thou art a part of him, and he is a part of thee, being both hewn out of the ſame Rock, formed and ſhaped of the ſame mould, and by lying to thy Brother, thou putt eſt a cheat upon thy ſelfe, and as far as in thee lyeth, upon that GOD that made you both, and gave you Tongues, not to lye, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct; and Wits, not to deceive, but counſell and help one another. And therefore in the 1 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 4.6. he deters them from fraud and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, by no other argument then this, That <hi>God is the avenger of ſuch things,</hi> as if the Lye had been told, and the Cheat put upon him. And when Mans juſtice to man faileth, there Gods vengeance is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to make a ſupply: For, ſaith <hi>Clemens, Vidiſti fratrem tuum? vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſti Deum tuum:</hi> When thou lookeſt upon thy Brother, <note place="margin">Clem. Alex. Strom. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> thou ſeeſt God himſelfe, as neere as Mortality can diſcover him; for he is the faireſt Copie thou canſt ſee him by, fairer then the Heaven of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and thoſe miniſters of light; fairer then the faireſt Star, then the Sun in the Firmament, when he rejoyceth to run his race. Hence Saint <hi>John</hi> concludes poſitively and peremptorily, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 4.20. <hi>If a man ſay he loveth God, and hateth his brother,</hi> (and he that deceives him, he that oppreſſeth him, hates him; or elſe deſpiſes him, which is worſe) <hi>he is a lyar:</hi> and his reaſon is irrefragable, <hi>For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath ſeen,</hi> in whom he ſees himſelf, in whom he ſees his God, and ſo hath love conveyed into his heart by his very eye, many viſible motives to win him to this duty, <hi>how can be love God whom he hath not ſeene?</hi> whom no man hath ſeen or can ſee, but, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>though a glaſſe darkly,</hi> in his words, and in his works, of which Man is the brighteſt Mirrour, and gives the faireſt and cleareſt repreſentation of him. So that now we may ſee all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind tyed and united together in this Love-knot of Nature; knit together as Men, that they ſhould not fly aſunder, and then returne
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:59296:328"/> again one upon another, not as Men, but as Snakes and Vipers; look back, but with an evil eye; approch neere, but in a cloud or tempeſt; not look, but envy; not ſpeak, but lye; not touch, but ſtrike; not converſe with, but defraud and oppreſſe one another; which is againſt that Law with which we were born, and which we carry about with us whitherſoever we goe, and whatſoever we doe.</p>

                  <p>How gracious and helpfull a creature is one man to another, if he continue ſo, a man, and receive no new impreſſion from the fleſh, from ſelf-love, and thoſe tranſitorie vanities below? if he be not by aſſed and wheel'd from this Naturall motion, by the world, and ſo fit to be drove into the field with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> being turn'd Fox, or Lion, or Tiger, or Panther, or worſe then any of thoſe Beaſts, becauſe he is a Man? (for ſo many forms he may receive, having once degenerated from his own) and then 'tis not: Look upon Men as of the ſame mould and frame, as Brethren by nature; as auxiliaries and ſupplyes, as keepers and guardians; but <hi>Cavete ab hominibus, Beware of men;</hi> a warning and caution given by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelfe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.17. and a ſtrange caution it is from him who ſo loved men that he dyed for them. <hi>Beware of men,</hi> beware of them thus transformed, thus Brutify'd. That ſmiling friend may be a tempter; He that calls himſelf a Saint, may be a Seducer; his oylie tongue may wound thee; his embrace cruſh thee to pieces; that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure countenance may ſhadow a legion of Devils. Look not upon his phylacteries, the Man's a Phariſee; and this Angel keeper may be thy Murderer. And thus it is when the courſe of nature is turn'd backward, and Man degenerates from himſelfe, and makes his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which ſhould be an inſtrument and promoter of Juſtice, a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to ſinne, and a weapon of unrighteouſneſſe.

<pb n="544" facs="tcp:59296:331"/> Truth, in Mercy, in Juſtice, nor upon that Saviour <hi>who knew no guile;</hi> who had this <hi>Elogium</hi> from his very enemies, That <hi>he had done all things well,</hi> and that <hi>there was no fault to be found in him.</hi> No, upon this foundation you muſt lay ſuch materialls which are like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, <hi>Innocency,</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſſe;</hi> which that they may grow up and flouriſh amongſt the ſons of men, he watered them with his Bloud, which was ſhed for the Oppreſſor, that he might be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull; for the Diſſembler, that he might ſpeak truth; for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull perſon, that he might be juſt in all his wayes, and righteous in all his dealings; for the violent perſon, that he might doe no more wrong; and if it have not this effect, it is his blood ſtill, but not to ſave us, but to be upon us to our condemnation. For 'tis ſtrange, that Chriſts blood ſhould produce nothing but a ſpeculative, a fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and an uſurped faith, a faith which ſhould keep thoſe evils in life, which he dyed to take away; a faith, which ſhould ſuffer thoſe ſinnes and irregularities, to grow and grow bold, and paſſe in triumph, which he came to root out of the earth, and to baniſh out of the world. Faith <hi>is the ſubſtance,</hi> the expectation of a future and better condition; but we do not uſe to expect a thing, and have no eye upon the meanes of attaining it. Can we expect to fly without wings, or go a journey without feet? no more can we hope ever to enter thoſe heavens, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſſe, if we have no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct but faith, faith ſo poorely and miſerably attended, with fraud, deceit, injuſtice, and violence. <hi>For who ſhall dwell in the holy hill?

                  <p>We muſt draw towards a concluſion: Thus have we ſhaken both the pillars of Juſtice, Nature and Grace, and put behind our backs the leſſons of the one, and precepts of the other, that we may run with leſſe regret and controll to that forbidden tree which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to look on.

And therefore it is but a buſie folly, a ſtudious kind of iniquity, to come and frame diſtinctions which may wipe out this relation, and ſo leave us at looſe with line enough to run out unto a liberty and priviledge of encroching on others by fraud or violence; As the <hi>Perſians</hi> in <hi>Xenophon</hi> taught their children, that they might lye or not lye with a diſtinction, lye loudly to their enemies, ſo they remember to ſpeak truth to their friends; deceive a ſtranger, and not an acquaintance; and I feare we have too many ſuch <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> in this our <hi>Iſland,</hi> and if they do not utter and dictate it, yet their hearts ſpeak it, and their hands ſpeake it, and their practice proclaimes it to the whole world. <hi>He is a ſtranger, he is an enemy, of another Religion, of another Faction,</hi> I may make what advantage I can upon him, undermine and blow him up; and thus the man, the image of God, the brother is quite loſt. And what is the iſſue of this Diabolicall coynage? even the ſame which <hi>Xenophon</hi> there ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be of the <hi>Perſian</hi> education. Their children, ſaith he, ſoone forgot the diſtinction, and grew up at laſt to be ſo bold as to lye to their beſt friends. And ſo it is with them who find it an eaſier thing to call themſelves Religious then to make themſelves honeſt; who firſt begin with theſe proviſo's and diſtinctions to practice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, and with ſo much gravity and demureneſſe to deceive their brethren, and to be diſhoneſt by a rule, at laſt they fall down to an univerſall and promiſcuous iniquity: Friends, brother, they of the ſame family, they of the ſame Sect and faction, all are the ſame with them; when they look for advantage, no reſpect of perſons; when they look for <hi>Balaams wages,</hi> every man then is a ſtranger, an enemy, or as ſtrangely, uſed as if he were; and this is to put out the light of nature, and ſo to go a whoring after our own inventions, which once kindled by the love of this world, are thoſe falſe lights which lead us into that darkneſſe which Saint <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of. He that thus handleth his brother, <note place="margin">1 Iohn 2.19.</note> 
                     <hi>walketh in darkneſſe, and knoweth not whither he goeth,</hi> becauſe darkneſſe hath blinded his eyes, that he cannot ſee a man in a man, nor a brother in a brother; a man in the ſame ſhape, and built up of the ſame materialls; a man of the ſame paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with himſelf.</p>
                  <pb n="549" facs="tcp:59296:334"/>
                  <p>And therefore by this light of Nature, let us check and condemn our ſelves, when any gall of bitterneſſe riſeth in our hearts; and allay, or rather root it out with this conſideration, That it is moſt inhumane and unnaturall, that we cannot nouriſh it in our breaſt, and not fall from the honour of our Creation, and leave off to be men. <hi>How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, and cut down to the ground? Eſ.</hi> 14.12. and how art thou fallen, O man, whoſoever thou art that doeſt unjuſtly, that takeſt from another that which is his, either by violence or deceit? How art thou fallen from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? (for on earth there is no other heaven, but that which Juſtice and Charity make;) How art thou fallen to hell it ſelf, nay to be an hell, a place for theſe foul ſpirits malice and fraud to reign and riot in, and to torment others and thy ſelf? How art thou fallen from converſing with Angels, to wallow in blood; from the glory of thy Creation to burning fire, and blackneſſe and darkneſſe and tempeſt? O what a ſhame is it, That a man thus created, thus Elemented and compoſed, ſhould delight in fraud, in violence and oppreſſion; ſhould feed on that bread not which his father who made him, did put into his hands, but which craft did purloine, or violence ſnatch from the hands of others who were not ſo wiſe or ſo ſtrong as himſelf? That this creature of love, made by love, and made to be Sociable, ſhould be as hot as a fiery furnace ſending forth nothing but ſulphur and ſtench? That this honourable Creature ſhould be a beaſt, nay a devil to enſnare, to accuſe, to deceive and deſtroy his brethren?</p>
                  <p>This is a ſad aggravation; but if the light of Nature be too dimme and cannot lead us out of the world, and thoſe winding and crooked paths, which the love of it makes in it every day, let us in the laſt place, look up upon that clearer light, that light <hi>which did ſpring from on high and hath viſited us;</hi> why ſhould not our friends be more powerfull with us then our enemies? why ſhould not Grace be ſtronger then a temptation? why ſhould not the rich and glorious promiſes of the Goſpel be more eloquent and perſwaſive, then the ſolicitations of the fleſh, which is every moment drawing neerer to the duſt; or of the world, which changeth every day, and ſhall at laſt be burnt with fire? why ſhould they not have the power to purge and clenſe us from all unrighteouſneſſe? why ſhould we chuſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be raiſed and enrich'd here for a ſpan of time, by craft and power, then to be crowned by Juſtice and Integrity for ever? For this is the end for which this great light hath ſhined, to lighten every man that is in the world, that they may walk in the paths of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. It is a light that leads unto bliſſe, but it will not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an oppreſſor, a theef, an Impoſtor, a Tyrant, to lead them to it, becauſe they delight not in it, and do but talk on't; <note place="margin">Math. 6.23.</note>

                  <p>To conclude then; That you may do juſtly, and walk honeſtly as in the day, conſider injuſtice, oppreſſion, and deceit in their true ſhape and proportion, and not dawbed over with untempered mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; not diſguiſed with the pleaſures and riches of the world; not vailed and dreſt up with pretences and Names, which make them lovely, and make them worſe; conſider well, and weigh the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of them, and from what they proceed. For firſt, If we would find out the fountain from whence they flow, we ſhall find it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a ſtrange diſtruſt in God, and a violent love of the world; a diſtruſt in that God who is ſo far from leaving man deſtitute of that which is convenient for him, that he feeds the young Ravens that call upon him. For if the windows of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven do not open at our call, if riches increaſe not to fill our vaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, we murmure and repine, and even chide the Providence of God, and by foul and indirect meanes purſue that which would not fall into our mouths. As <hi>aul,</hi> in the book of <hi>Kings, Acheronta movemus,</hi> when God will not anſwer, we ask counſel of the devil.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we may think perhaps that they are the effects of Power and Wiſdome, the works of men who beare a brain with the beſt; that they are the glorious victories of our wit, and Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of our Power; but indeed they are the infallible Arguments of weakneſſe and impotency, and as the devils marks upon us. <hi>Non eſt vera magnitudo peſſe nocere,</hi> It is not true power nor true greatneſſe to be able to injure our brethren; It is not true wiſdome to be cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning artiſts in evil, and to do that in the dark which may be done with more certainty and Honour in the light; and to raiſe up that with a lye, which will riſe higher, and ſtand longer with the truth. That power more emulates the power of God, by which we can do good, That comes neerer by which we will; nor can we attribute wiſdome to the fraudulent, but that which we may give to a Jugler or a Pick-purſe, or indeed to the Devil himſelf. And commonly theſe ſcarabees are bred in the dung of Lazineſſe and Luxury, and their crafty inſinuating, their ſubtle ſliding into other mens eſtate had its riſe and beginning from an indiſpoſition and inability to manage their own. He that can bring no demonſtration, muſt play the Sophiſter; and if the body will not do, then he that will be rich, ſaith <hi>Neviſanus</hi> the Lawyer, muſt venture his ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, weigh the danger of it; for though the bread of deceit have a pleaſant taſte, and goes down glibly, yet paſſing to thee through ſo foul a chanel as fraud or oppreſſion, it will fill thee with
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:59296:335"/> the gall of Aſps. <hi>The robbery of the wicked ſhall deſtroy them,</hi> ſaith <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, Prov.</hi> 21.7. ſhall fall upon them like that talent of lead, and fall upon the mouth of their <hi>Ephah,</hi> and lye heavy upon it. <hi>Serrabit eos,</hi> as it is rendred by others, ſhall teare their conſcience, as with a ſaw; <hi>exoſſabit,</hi> as others, ſhall conſume them to the very bones, and break them as upon a wheele; or as others, <hi>Rapina eorum diverſabitur,</hi> That which is got unjuſtly ſhall not ſtay long with them. It may give them a ſalutation, a complement, <hi>peregrinabitur,</hi> like a traveller on the way, it may lodge with them for a night, but dwell longer as with a friend it will not, but take the wing and fly away from theſe unjuſt uſurpers, never at reſt but in thoſe hands which are <hi>waſht in innocency,</hi> and in that mouth which knows no guile; will dwell with none but thoſe that <hi>do juſtly.</hi> To conclude; <hi>Tribulation and anguiſh</hi> upon every ſoul of man who doth that which is evil and unjuſt; to the oppreſſor and deceiver, to the man that <hi>boaſteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his power,</hi> and to the man that bleſſeth himſelf in his craft; to the proud Hypocrite, and the demure Politician; but to thoſe that <hi>do juſtly,</hi> that are as God is, juſt in all their waies, and righteous in all their dealings, that walk holily before God, and Juſtly with men, ſhall be Glory, and Honour, and peace, and immortality, and eternall life.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of Juſtice and Honeſty: the next is, the <hi>Love of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> but, &amp;c.</p>

And here though miracles be ceaſed, yet by the bleſſing of a God of mercy, it retains a miraculous power; it heales the ſick, binds up the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:59296:337"/> raiſes the poor out of the duſt, and in a manner raiſes the dead to life again, upholds the drooping and the fainting ſpirit which is ready to faile; intercedes, and fights againſt the cruelty of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; fills up the breaches which they make, raiſes up that which they ruine; clothes the naked, whom they have ſtripped; builds up what they have pulled down; and is as a quickning power, a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to thoſe whom the hand of wickedneſſe and injuſtice hath laid low, and even buried in the duſt. A branch it is which ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and refreſheth all thoſe <hi>who are diminiſhed, and brought low by oppreſsion, evil and ſorrow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And theſe too, <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> are neighbouring branches, ſo enwrapped, and entwined one within the other, that you cannot ſever them. For where there is no Juſtice there can be no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and where there is no <hi>Mercy,</hi> there Juſtice is but Gall and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood: and therefore in the Scripture they go hand in hand, <hi>unto the upright man there ariſeth light in darkneſſe, he is gracious, and full of compaſsion, and righteous. Pſal.</hi> 112.4. There is an eye of Juſtice, a ſingle and upright eye, as well as an eye of mercy: There is an eye that <hi>looks right on, Proverb.</hi> 4.25. and there is a <hi>bountifull eye, Prov.</hi> 22.9. and if you ſhut but one of them, you are in darkneſſe; he that hath an evil eye to ſtrip his brother, can never ſee to clothe him; he whoſe feet are ſwift to ſhed blood, will be but a cripple when he is called to the houſe of mourning; and if his bowels be ſhut up, his hand will be ſoon ſtretcht out to beat his fellow-ſervants. <note place="margin">Pſ. 147.1.</note> 
                     <hi>It becometh the juſt to be thankfull.</hi> In their mouth praiſe is comely, it is a ſong, 'tis muſick, and it becometh the <hi>Juſt</hi> to be mercifull and liberall; out of their heart mercy flows kindly, ſtreames forth like the River out of <hi>Eden,</hi> to water the dry places of the earth; there you <hi>ſhall find gold, and good gold, Bdellium,</hi> and the <hi>Oynx ſtone;</hi> all that is precious in the ſight of God and man. But the heart of an unjuſt man is as a rock on which you may ſtrike and ſtrike again, but no water will flow out, but inſtead thereof gall and worm-wood, blood and fire, <hi>and the vapour of ſmoke.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ioel 2.30. Prov. 12.10.</note> 
                     <hi>The tender mercies,</hi> the bowels of <hi>the wicked are cruel,</hi> their <hi>kiſſes</hi> are <hi>wounds,</hi> their favours reproches, their Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences <hi>Anathema's;</hi> their bread is full of gravell, and their water tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with blood. If their craft or power take all, and their ſeeming mercy, their hypocriſie put back a part, that part is nothing, or but trouble and vexation of ſpirit. Thus do theſe two branches grow and flouriſh, and bring forth fruit, and thus do they wither and dye together.</p>
                  <p>And here we have a faire and a full vintage, for indeed mercy is as the vine, which yeeldeth wine to cheere the hearts of men; hath nothing of the <hi>Bramble,</hi> nothing of the <hi>fire,</hi> nothing that can devour; it yeeldeth much fruit, but we cannot ſtand to gather all. I might
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:59296:337"/> ſpread before you the rich mantle of mercy, and diſplay each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular beauty and glory of it; but it will ſuffice to ſet it up as the object of our <hi>Love:</hi> for as Miſery is the object of our Mercy, ſo is Mercy the object of our Love; And we may obſerve, it is not here to <hi>doe mercifully,</hi> as before <hi>to doe juſtly</hi> (and yet if we love not Juſtice, we cannot doe it) but in expreſſe termes the Lord requires that <hi>we love mercy,</hi> that is, that we put it on, weare it as a robe of Glory, delight in it, make it (as God doth make it his) our chiefeſt attribute to exalt, and ſuperexaltate; to make it triumph over Juſtice it ſelf. For Juſtice and Honeſty gives every man his owne but Mercy opens thoſe Treaſuries which Juſtice might lock up; and takes from us that which is legally ours; makes others gatherers with us, partakers of our basket, and brings them under our own vine and fig-tree; <hi>Et haec eſt victoria,</hi> this is the victory and triumph of Mercy.</p>
                  <p>Let us then draw the lines by which we are to paſſe, and we ſhall firſt, ſhew you Mercy in the fruit it yeelds; ſecondly, in its root: Firſt, in its <hi>proper act</hi> or motion, <hi>caſting bread upon the waters,</hi> and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the poore out of the duſt: Secondly, in the <hi>forme</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth this act, or the <hi>principle</hi> of this motion, which is the habit, the affection, the love of mercy; for ſo we are commanded, not onely to ſhew forth our mercy, but to <hi>love</hi> it; for <hi>what doth the Lord require, but to love mercy? &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We begin with the firſt; and the proper act of mercy is to flow, to ſpend it ſelf, and yet not be ſpent, to relieve our brethren in miſery, and in all the degrees that lead to it, neceſſities, impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, diſtreſſes, dangers, defects; This is it which the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. And howſoever fleſh and blood may be ready to perſwade us that we are left at large to our own wills, and may do what we will with our own, yet if we conſult with the Oracle of God, we ſhall find that theſe reciprocall offices of mercy which paſſe between man and man, are a debt; That we are bound as much to do good to others, as not to injure them; to ſupply their wants, as not to rob them; to reach forth a hand to help them, as not to ſmite them with the fiſt of wickedneſſe; and though my hundred meaſures of wheat be my own, and I may demand them, yet there is a voice from heaven, and from the mercy-ſeat, which bids me take the bill and ſit down quickly and <hi>write fifty.</hi> Do we ſhut up our bowels and our hands together? Behold, <hi>Habemus legem,</hi> we have a Law, and the firſt and greateſt Law, the Law of Charity, to open them. 'Tis true, what we gain by the ſweat of our brows, what Honeſty and Induſtry, or the Law hath ſealed unto us, is ours <hi>ex aſſe,</hi> wholly and entirely ours, nor can any Hand but that of Violence divide it from us: but yet <hi>Habemus legem,</hi> we have a Law, another Law, which doth not take from us the propriety of our Goods, but yet binds
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:59296:338"/> us to diſpenſe and diſtribute them: In the ſame Court-roll of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven we are made both Proprietaries, &amp; Stewards. The Law of God as well as of Man is Evidence for us, that our poſſeſſions are ours; but it is Evidence againſt us, if we uſe them not to that end for which God made them ours. They are ours, <hi>to have and to hold,</hi> nor can any Law of man divorce them from us, or queſtion us: For what Action can be drawn againſt want of mercy? who was ever yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaded for not giving an Almes at his doore? what bar can you bring the <hi>Miſer</hi> to? who ever was arraigned for doing no good? but yet in the Law of God, and in the Goſpel of Chriſt, which is a Law of Grace, we find an action drawn <hi>de non veſtiendis nudis,</hi> for not <hi>clothing the Naked,</hi> not <hi>feeding the Hungry,</hi> not <hi>viſiting the Sick;</hi> I, ſaith <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> could peradventure be willing, That Mercy and Bounty were not <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> but <hi>arbitrary;</hi> not under a Law, but preſented by way of <hi>Counſel</hi> and advice (for the fleſh is weak, and would go to Heaven with as little coſt and trouble as may be) but then the mention of the <hi>Left hand</hi> and the <hi>right;</hi> of the <hi>Goates;</hi> of the torments they ſhall be thrown into, not who have invaded o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens goods, but who have not given theirs; not who have beat down, but who have not ſupported theſe Temples of the Holy Ghoſt; this is that which ſtrikes a terrour through me, and makes me think and reſolve, That I am as much bound to do acts of mercy, as I am not to do an injury; as much bound to feed the poore man, as I am not to oppreſſe and murder him: To ſhew mercy to others, is not an <hi>Evangelicall Counſel,</hi> it is a Law. And therefore as <hi>Homer</hi> tells us, when he ſpeaks of rivers or birds, That men did not call them by their proper names, for the Gods had other names for them, <hi>Chalcidem homines, Cymindim Dii vocant;</hi>

I make no doubt but Gods Mercy is ready to ſhine upon ours, for he loves it, and loves to look on't. I doubt not but he rewards our Mercy with the bleſſings of this life; for a cup of cold water, which the hand of mercy fills, and poures out, gives many times riches and honour though we perceive it not, but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute it to ſomething elſe; to our wiſdome and induſtry rather then to that Providence which alwaies waiteth upon mercy, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it in the work, and bleſſing it when the work is done: but what are theſe to that reward which is laid up for thoſe who do <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minare in benedictionibus,</hi> who ſow plentifully? what are riches that have wings, to immortality? what's a Palace to heaven? we viſit the ſick, and the ſpirit of comfort viſits us; we ſerve our brethren, and the Angels miniſter unto us; we cover the naked with our

I know that all our actions are to be ſquared by the rule, and that it may ſavour of great folly to be wiſer then that wiſdome that taught us; but yet I cannot think that a God of Mercy, that loves it in himſelf, and in his creature, will look in anger upon thoſe who through too much Fervour and Ambition of doing all, do more then is required, but favour and reward them rather; when he will ſeverely puniſh that negligence that binds our hands in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, that we do nothing. <hi>Melius ultra quam citra ſtat miſericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> Thee is leſſe danger, (in the works of Mercy) to exceed then to fall ſhort; I may ſay, leſſe danger in ſuperſtition then in profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; leſſe danger in giving all then in giving nothing; and I can ſee no reaſon there ſhould be bounds ſet to our Mercy, for this is the way to ſhut it up quite, and then we can ſet the bounds where we pleaſe; our <hi>non ultra</hi> will be a penny, a mite, a cup of cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and at laſt nothing. I will not cenſure the devotion of theſe women, and I need not take any paines to frame an Apologie for them; He that ſhall be ſo bold as to paſſe ſentence againſt them, will betray in himſelf ſo much love of the world as will deſerve a heavier doom; and although I may not preſſe it as a duty on every man, yet thus much we may gain by it, as to conclude, That if theſe women attained to this ſo high perfection, as to be willing to ſtrip themſelves of all, and give it to the poore, It is not ſo hard a matter as we make it, to part with our ſuperfluities; as eaſie for Mercy to open our hands now as then; and if this exceſſe of theirs were as a rock which we ſhould avoid (as indeed it is not) yet what need they to feare it who are ſo unwilling to ſet out, or to follow them but ſo far as to the meane, and thoſe Tropicks which we our ſelves ſet up, and do acknowledge in our courſe? <note place="margin">

<pb n="564" facs="tcp:59296:342"/> thus did entice and draw others to their faction, as men do children with a cake, whom they mean afterwards to deſtroy.

                  <p>But let us not deceive our ſelves; This duty is written in laſting characters to all poſterity. Poverty and contempt of the world will be beatitudes to the worlds end. Mercy and compaſſion are everlaſting duties; to part with our coate to our brother, is as neceſſary now as when Chriſt firſt taught it. Why ſhould we paraphraſe mercy, and coine diſtinctions, and draw out our limitations, as it were to copſe her up and confine her, that ſhe ſhall not move our tongue or hand, but when our luſts will give her leave? <hi>Be ye mercifull as your Heavenly Father is mercifull;</hi> why that's impoſſible, and therefore becauſe we cannot reach ſo far, we will not ſtir a foot. <hi>Lend looking for nothing again;</hi> That cannot bind us, in the letter; and ſo, though we may be perſwaded to lend, yet our covetouſneſſe ſhall have line enough to reach the debtor, and take him by the throat, and make him lay down what he owes, with the advantage. <hi>Go ſell all thou haſt;</hi> that was ſpoken to the young man, and ſo concernes us not; 'Tis true, <hi>to ſell all and give it to the poore,</hi> was a particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to the young man in the Goſpel, and with this command, Chriſt made a window into his breaſt, and diſcovered the rottenneſſe of his heart.

For ſhould our Saviour come with his fan in his hand, he would find too much of this chaffe, diſcover too many who are ready to ſubſcribe to the Decalogue, to thoſe commands which they are too ready to break, but have no hand at all to fling one mite into the treaſurie; too many ſo like this young man in this, that they may well receive this ſtrict command, <hi>Go ſell all that you have and give it to the poore.</hi> For the love of the world is a foule humour, and no other pill can purge it out; nor can this <hi>Augaean Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> the heart of a covetous man be purged without a <hi>Hercules,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then by a ſtrong and violent evacuation: No better reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy againſt the love of the world then thus <hi>exhaeredare ſe ſeculo,</hi>

                  <p>Now compaſſion is the ſpring and principle of Mercy, when it exerciſeth its act, when it teacheth the ignorant, or feeds the poore.

The word <hi>Church</hi> is but as a ſecond notion, and it is made a terme of art, and every man almoſt, ſaith <hi>Luther,</hi> abuſeth it, draws it forth after his own image, takes it commonly in that ſenſe which may favour him ſo far, as to leave in him a perſwaſion that he is a true part of it; and thus many enter the Church, and are ſhut out of heaven. We are told of a viſible Church, and the Church in ſome ſenſe is viſible; but that the greateſt part of this Church hath wanted bowells; that ſome parts of it have been without ſenſe or feeling, beſmered and defiled with the blood of
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:59296:344"/> their brethren, is as viſible as the Church. We have heard of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Church, we have heard it, and believe it not; for how can ſhe be infallible who is ſo ready to deſign all thoſe to death and hell who deny it? If it be a Church, it is a Church with hornes to puſh at the nations, or an army with banners and ſwords; we have long talked of a <hi>Reformed Church,</hi> and we make it our crown and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, but it would concern us to look about us and take heed, That we do not reforme ſo as to purge out all compaſſion alſo; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cainly to <hi>put off all bowells,</hi> is not (as ſome zelots have eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded themſelves) to put on the <hi>new man.</hi> Talk not of a <hi>viſible, Infallible,</hi> or a <hi>Reformed</hi> Church; God ſend us a <hi>Compaſsionate</hi> Church; a title, which will more fit and become her, then thoſe names which do not beautifie and adorne, but accuſe and condemn her when ſhe hath <hi>no heart.</hi> What viſible Church is that which is ſeen in blood? what infallible Church is that whoſe very bowels are cruell? what reformed Church is that which hath purged out all compaſſion? viſible, and yet not ſeen; infallible, and deceived; reformed, and yet in its filth; <hi>Monſtrum; Horrendum, Informe,</hi> This is a miſhapen monſter, not a Church. The True Church is made up of bowells; every part of it is tender and relenting, not onely when it ſelf is touch'd, but when the others are moved; as you ſee in a well-ſet inſtrument, if you touch but one ſtring, the others will tremble and ſhake. And this ſence, this fellow-feeling, is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from whence this ſilver ſtreame of Mercy flows, the ſpring and firſt mover of thoſe outward acts, which are ſeen in that bread of ours which floats upon the waters, in the face and on the backs of the poore; for not then when we ſee our brethren in affliction, when we look upon them, and paſſe by them, but when we ſee them, and have compaſſion on them, we ſhall bind up their wounds, and poure in wine and oyle, and take care for them: For till the heart be melted there will nothing flow. We ſee almes given every day, and we call them acts of piety; but whether the hand of Mercy reach them forth or no we know not; our motions, all of them are not from a right ſpring; vain glory may be liberall; Intemperance may be liberall; Pride may be a benefactor; Ambition muſt not be a Niggard; Covetouſneſſe it ſelf ſometimes yeelds, and drops a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and importunity is a wind which will ſet that wheel a going, which had otherwiſe ſtood ſtill. We may read large catalogues of munificent men, but many names which we read there may be but the names of <hi>men,</hi> and not of the <hi>Mercifull:</hi> compaſſion is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and true principle, begetting in us the <hi>love of Mercy,</hi> which compleats, and perfects, and crownes every act; gives it its true forme and denomination; gives a ſweet ſmell, and fragrant ſavour to <hi>Maryes</hi> oyntment, for ſhe that poured it forth <hi>loved much, Luk.</hi> 7.47. I may ſay compaſſion is the <hi>love of the Mercy, &amp; plus eſt diligere quàm facere,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hilary,</hi> It is a great deal more to love a good
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:59296:344"/> work then to do it; to love virtue, then to bring it into act; to love mercy, then to ſhew it; it doth ſupply many times the place of the outward act, but without it the act is nothing, or ſomething worſe. It hath a priviledge to bring that upon account which was never done; to be entitled to that which we do not, which we cannot do; to make the weak man ſtrong, and the poore man liberall, and the ignorant man a counſellor; For he that loves mercy would, and therefore doth more then he can do; as <hi>David</hi> may be ſaid to build the Temple, though he laid not a ſtone of it, for God tells him, <hi>he did well, That he had it in his heart;</hi> and thus our love may build a Temple, though we fall and dye before a ſtone be laid.</p>
                  <p>Now this <hi>love of mercy</hi> is not ſo ſoon wrought in the heart as we may imagine; as every glimmering of light doth not make it day; It is a work of labour and travell, and of curious obſervance and watchfulneſſe over our ſelves; It will coſt us many a combate and luctation with the world and the fleſh; many a falling out with our ſelves; many a love muſt be digged up by the roots, before we can plant this in our hearts; for it will not grow up with luxury and wantonneſſe; with pride, or ſelf-love; you never ſee theſe together in the ſame ſoyle: The Apoſtle tells us we muſt <hi>put it on;</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the garments which adorn the ſoul are not ſo ſoon put on as thoſe which clothe the body; we do not put on mercy as we do our mantle, for when we do, every puffe of wind, every diſtaſte blows it away; but mercy muſt be ſo put on, that it may even cleave to the ſoul, and be a part of it; That every thought may be a melting thought, every word as oyle, and every work a bleſſing. Then we love mercy, when we fling off all other reſpects, and whatſoever may either ſhrink up or ſtraiten our bowells, or ſeale up our lips, or wither our hands; when we look upon the world but as our ſtage, where we muſt act our parts, and diſplay the glories of mercy; where we muſt waſte our ſelves, drop our teares, run in to ſuccour thoſe who are roughly handled in it, and thus tread it under our feet, and then take our <hi>Exit</hi> and go out. When we can forget our honour, and remember the poore; forſake all rather then our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and deſire not to be rich but in good works; when we have ſo incorporated out brethren into our ſelves, that we ſtand and fall, are happy and miſerable together; when we conſider them as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into the <hi>ſame Chriſt,</hi> and in him to be preferred before the whole world, and to be lookt upon as thoſe for whom we muſt dye, Then <hi>we love mercy,</hi> then <hi>we are mercifull as our heavenly Father is mercifull.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus if we be qualified, we ſhall become the Temples and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Mercy; and as our bodies ſhall after their reſurrection, ſo our ſoules ſhall here have <hi>novas dotes,</hi> ſhall be endowed with activity,
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:59296:345"/> cheerfulneſſe, and purity. And firſt, our mercy will be in a manner <hi>Naturall</hi> unto us: ſecondly, it will be <hi>Conſtant:</hi> thirdly, it will be <hi>Sincere:</hi> fourthly, it will be <hi>Delightfull</hi> to us. It will be <hi>Naturall,</hi> not forced; it will be <hi>Conſtant,</hi> not flitting; It will be <hi>Sincere,</hi> not feigned; and it will be <hi>Delightfull,</hi> that we ſhall long to bring it into act.</p>
                  <p>And firſt; we then love it, when it is in a manner made naturall to us; for we never fully ſee the beauty of it, till we are made <hi>New Creatures,</hi> and have new eyes; then as the new creature <hi>cannot ſin,</hi> as Saint <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, that is, can doe nothing that is contrary and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to that forme which conſtitutes a new creature, no more can a mercifull man doe any thing which will not ſavour of mercy; and doth as naturally exerciſe himſelfe in it, as the Sunne doth ſend forth its beames, or the Heavens their influence. For the Spirit of God hath made his Heart a Fountain of Mercy, as he made the Sun a Fountain of Light; and if he break not forth into action, it is from defect of means, or occaſion, or ſome croſſe accident which comes over him, which doe but cloud and eclipſe his mercy, as the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of a groſſe body doth the Sun, but not put out its light; at the very ſight of Miſery, Mercy is awake, up, and either doing of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. <hi>Who is weak,</hi>

If occaſion preſents it ſelfe, it ſoon layes hold of it; If the object appeare, it is carryed to it with the ſpeed of a Thought, and reacheth it as ſoone; If there be no object, it creates one; if there be no occaſion, it ſtudyes one: <hi>Is there yet any left of the houſe of Saul, that I may ſhew kindneſſe to for Jonathans ſake?</hi> And, Is there no Lazar to feed, no Widow to viſit, no Wounds to bind up, no weak brother to be reſtored, none that be in darkneſſe and error to be brought into the light? Theſe are the <hi>Quaeres,</hi> the true dialect, this is the Ambition of Mercy: It longs more for an occaſion to vent it ſelf, then the Adulterer doth for the twilight; layes hold of the leaſt as of a great one; thinks nothing too high, nothing too low, which it can reach; is ſtill in motion, becauſe it moves not like thoſe Artificiall bodies by art or outward force, but by a principle of life, the ſpirit of love; and ſo moves, not as a clock, which will ſtand ſtill when the plummet is on the ground, but its motion is Naturall, as that of the ſpheres, which are wheel'd about without ceſſation, and return by thoſe points by which they paſt; and indeed, may be ſaid rather to reſt then to move, becauſe they move con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:59296:345"/> and in the ſame place. Miſery is the point, the object of mercy, and at that it toucheth everlaſtingly: mercy and miſery ſtill go together and eye each other; the eye of miſery looks up upon mercy, and the eye of mercy looks down upon miſery; they are the two cherubins, that have ever their faces one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they are both full and ready to drop and run down; the eye of miſery is ever open, and mercy <hi>hideth not her eye, Prov.</hi> 28.27. By this you may judge of your acts of liberality, and look upon them as thoſe ſacrifices with which God is pleaſed, when you find ſomething within you that enlargeth you, that opens your mouth and hand, that you cannot but ſpeak and do; when you find a heat within you that thaws and melts you, that you poure out your ſelves on your brethren; then your works of mercy are of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour, when love ſets them on fire.</p>
                  <p>For ſecondly, being made Naturall unto us, it will be alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, it will be fixt in the firmament of the ſoul, and ſhine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive its influence unceſſantly, and equally, doing <hi>good unto all men,</hi> while <hi>it hath time,</hi> that is at all times. When the heart diſſents from it ſelf (for love onely unites and makes it one,) when it is <hi>diviſum cor, a divided heart,</hi> divided between God and the world; when it hath inconſtant motions, and changeable counſells, when it joynes with the object, and leaps from the object; willing to day and loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to morrow; this day cleaving to it, and even ſick for love, (as <hi>Ammon</hi> was with <hi>Tamar</hi>) and the next thruſting it out of doores; chuſing without judgement, and then altering upon experience; In ſuch a heart mercy cannot dwell; and from hence it is that we ſee men every day ſo unlike themſelves, now giving, anon oppreſſing; now reaching out an Almes, and by and by threatning with the ſword; now giving their brother the right hand of fellowſhip, and within a while with that hand plucking him by the throat; now pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying him that lyes in the duſt, and anon crying out, So, So, Thus we would have it: For indeed their pity and their rage, their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and their cruelty have the ſame originall, are raiſed upon the ſame ground, the love of themſelves, and not of mercy; and thus they do ſome acts of mercy, <hi>magno impetu, ſed ſemel,</hi> with much earneſtneſſe and zeale, but not often, like ſome birds whoſe notes or rather noiſe we heare one part of the year, and then they leave us, vaniſh out of ſight and hearing, and as ſome ſay, ſleep out the other.

Then mercy is in its full glory, when it acts upon a certain and well grounded determination; when we decree, as the Stoicks ſpeak, and reſolve ſo to do, when we have fixed this decree, and made it unalterable; when we are rooted and grounded in mercy, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. Rooted as a tree deeply in it, and built as a houſe upon it, where the corner and chief ſtone is the <hi>love of mercy.</hi> Then we are as trees to ſhadow o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and as an houſe to ſhelter them; otherwiſe our mercy will be but as a gourd, as <hi>Jonahs gourd,</hi> and will grow and come up and periſh in a night.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If we love mercy, it will be ſincere and reall; for ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is the proper iſſue and child of love, and makes the <hi>wounds</hi> of a friend better then the <hi>kiſſes</hi> of an enemy; makes a <hi>diſh of herbs</hi> a more ſumptuous Feaſt then a <hi>ſtalled</hi> oxe; makes a mite, a good wiſh, a good word an Almes. What's the mercy of the paraſite? he feeds by it. What's the mercy of the Ambitious? a ſtirrop to get up by. What's the mercy of the Covetous? a piece of art, a warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table cheat. What was that ſeeming mercy of <hi>Peter?</hi> It was an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, for which Chriſt called him an enemy. What's the mercy of thoſe, who through <hi>Covetouſneſſe, with feigned words make a prey of mens ſoules?</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. I will not tell you, becauſe I cannot give it a name bad enough. There may be mercy in a ſupply, but that ſupply may be a ſnare. There may be mercy in counſel, but that counſel may betray me. There is mercy in comfort, but we know, there be miſerable comforters. True mercy muſt be like our faith, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

                     </gap>, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. unfeigned, and then it runs muſt pure and cleare without taint or trouble, when love opens the fountain, or rather is the fountain from whence it flows; when the love of Chriſt hath begot in us the love of our brethren, and we ſhew mercy to them, not for thoſe arguments which we make our ſelves, or thoſe perſwaſions which may be the oratory of the fleſh and the world; but for Chriſts ſake, and for the love of mercy, whoſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall and demonſtrative eloquence we ſhould moſt obey: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it will begin fairely, and end in blood; It will drop teares, and then hailſtones; it will be a but preface of clemency, a mild prologue to lead in a tragedy; an <hi>echo</hi> out of a ſepulchre of rotten bones, and as muſick at the gates of hell: It will be mercy, but not like unto Chriſt, in whom there <hi>was found no guile,</hi> but like unto <hi>Marcions</hi> Chriſt, all in appearance; mercy with a trumpet in one hand, and a ſword in the other; mercy which ſhall leſſen your burthen, to lay on more; ſhall ſpeak of eaſe, and then add to the miſery of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. For that which is not ſincere is not laſting. It may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſhine, but it will end in a ſtorme: A true face is ever the ſame, but a vizor will ſoon fall off. In a word, if it be not ſincere, it is not
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:59296:346"/> mercy, and ſincere it will not, it cannot be, if we love it not.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all; If we love mercy we ſhall take delight in it, for joy is but a reſultancie from love; that which we love is alſo the joy of our heart. <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I have choſen,</hi> ſaith God of Chriſt, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 42.1. and then it follows, <hi>In whom my ſoule delights.</hi> I have <hi>loved thee,</hi> ſaith God, of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and his love thus beſpeaks them, <hi>as a bridegroome rejoyceth over his bride, ſo ſhall thy God rejoyce over thee, Iſ.</hi> 62.5. The bridegroome is ſick of love in the book of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> his heart is raviſh'd, and then the floodgates are laid open, and the ſtreame is joy. <hi>How faire is my love? how much better is thy love then wine, and the ſmell of thy oyntments then all ſpices? Davids</hi> heart was knit unto <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and then, <hi>very pleaſant haſt thou been unto me,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Abraham</hi> loved hoſpitality, and therefore he is ſaid <hi>to ſit in his tent doore, in the heat of the day,</hi> to invite men in, as if every ſtranger had been an Angel. If love be as the ſunne, Joy and delight are the Beames which ſtreame forth from it; If Love be as the Voice, Joy is the Echo, for Joy is but Love in the refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; If Love fill the heart, it will heave, and work it ſelf out, and break forth in joy. By our joy we may ſee the figure, and ſhape, and conſtitution of our ſouls; for Love is operative, working and raiſing up ſomething in the ſoul, and with it that delight which is born with it, and alwaies waits upon it. If it be darke and ſcarce obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, our Joy interprets it; Joy is open and talkative; In the wanton 'tis a frolick; in the Revenger it is a Boaſt; in the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard it is a Ballad; in the Rich it is Pride; in the Ambitious it is a Triumph; but in the Mercifull it is Heaven. What a well-drawn picture is to an <hi>Apelles,</hi> what a faire character is to a Scribe, what a heap of gold is to the Miſer, that and much more are the works of Mercy to them that love it; onely here the joy is of a purer flame, and burns brighter; that is groſſe and earthy, this is Seraphicall. When you reach forth your hand to give a peny, tell me, what doe you feele in your heart? when you give good counſel, doe you not heare a pleaſing echo return back upon you? when you have lifted up the poore out of the duſt, doe you not feele an elevation and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion in your mind? when you clothe the naked, are not you even then <hi>ſuper veſtiti,</hi> clothed upon with joy? Beleeve it, you cannot give that relief to the miſerable, which Mercy works in the ſoul, nor can he that receives be ſo much affected as he that gives; For when he gives, he gives indeed his money, but hath beſtowed the greateſt Almes upon himſelf; the poore man rejoyceth, as a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry man that's fed, as a naked man that's clothed, as one that ſits in darkneſſe doth at the breaking in of light; but the mercifull man hath triumphs and <hi>Jubilees</hi> within him. In a word, to love Mercy is to be in Heaven, <hi>every man according as he purpoſeth in his heart,</hi> let him give <hi>not grudgingly, or of neceſsity, for God loveth a cheerfull gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;</hi>
                     <pb n="574" facs="tcp:59296:347"/> ſuch a mercy is Gods Almoner here on earth, and he loves and bleſſeth it, follows it with his providence, and his infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhall crown it. That gift which the <hi>Love of Mercy</hi> offereth up, is onely fit to be laid up in the Treaſury of the Almighty.</p>
                  <p>And now I have ſet before you Mercy in its full beauty, in all its glory; <note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> you have ſeen her ſpreading her raies: I might ſhew you her building of Hoſpitalls, viſiting the ſick, giving eyes to the blind, raiſing of Temples, pittying the ſtones, breathing forth Oracles, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ignorant wiſe, the ſorrowfull merry, leading the wandring man into his way; I might have ſhewed you her ſealing of Pardons (but we could not ſhew you all) theſe are the miracles of Mercy, and they are wrought by the power of Chriſt in us, and by us, but by his power; the faireſt ſpectacle in the world. Let us then look upon it, and love it: what is mercy when you need it? is it not as the opening of the heavens unto you? and ſhall it then bea puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and hell unto you, when your afflicted brethren call for it? Is it ſo glorious abroad, and ſhall it be of ſo foul an aſpect, as not to be thought worthy of entertainment at home? ſhall it be a Jewel in every Cabinet but your own hearts? Behold, and lift up your eyes, and you ſhall ſee objects enough for your Mercy to ſhine on; If ever one depth called upon another, the depth of calamity for the depth of our compaſſion; if ever our bowells ſhould move and ſound, now, now is the time. I remember, that <hi>Chryſologus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that God did on purpoſe lay <hi>Lazarus</hi> at the rich mans Gate, <hi>quaſi pietatis conflatorium,</hi> as a forge to melt his ſtony heart. <hi>Lazarus</hi> had as many mouthes to ſpeak, and move him to compaſſion, as he had ulcers and wounds; and how many ſuch forges hath God ſet before us? how many mouthes to beſeech us? how many wounds wide open which ſpeak loud for our pity? how many fires to melt us? ſhall I ſhew you an ulcerous <hi>Lazar?</hi> They are obvious to our eye, we ſhall have them alwaies with us, ſaith our Saviour, and we have them almoſt in every place: Shall I ſhew you men Stript and wounded, and left half dead? that may be ſeen in our lives, as well as in the high waies between <hi>Jericho</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Shall I ſhew you the teares drilling down the cheeks of the orphans and wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows? ſhall I call you to heare the cry of the hire kept back by fraud or violence? for that cryes to you for compaſſion, as oppreſſion doth to God for vengeance; and it is a kind of oppreſſion to deny it them. <hi>Have you no compaſsion all ye that paſſe by,</hi> and every day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſuch ſad ſpectacles as theſe? ſhall I ſhew you Chriſt put again to open ſhame, whipt, and ſcorned, and crucified, and that which cannot be done to him in his perſon, laid upon his Church? ſhall I ſhew you him now upon the croſſe, and have you no <hi>regard all you that paſſe by?</hi> ſhall I ſhew you the Church miſerably torn in pieces? ſhall I ſhew you Religion? I would I could ſhew you ſuch a ſight, for
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:59296:347"/> ſcarce ſo much as her forme is left; what can I ſhew, or what can move us, when neither our own miſery, nor the common miſery, nor ſinne, nor death, nor hell it ſelf will move us? If we were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good Men, or good Citizens, or good Chriſtians, our hearts would melt and guſh forth at our eyes in Rivers of water; If we were truly affected with peace, we ſhould be troubled at war; If we did love the City, we ſhould mourn over it; if we did delight in the proſperity of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> her affliction would wound us; if Religion were our care, her decay would be our ſorrow; for that which we love and delight in muſt needs leave a mournfull heart behind it, when it withdraws it ſelf. But private intereſt makes us regardleſſe of the common, and we do not pity Religion becauſe we do not pitty our own ſoules, but drink deep of the pleaſures of this world; enlarge our Territories, fill our barnes, make haſte to be rich, when our ſoul is ready to be taken from us, and nothing but a rotten mouldring wall, a body of fleſh which will ſoon fall to the ground, between us and hell.</p>
                  <p>I may well take off your eye from theſe ſad and wofull ſpectacles; it had been enough but to have ſhewn you Mercy, for ſhe is a cloud of witneſſes, a cloud of Arguments for her ſelf; and if we would but look upon her as we ſhould, there need no other Orator. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you look into your Leaſe, look into your Covenant, that Conveyance by which bliſſe and immortality are made over to you, and you ſhall find that you hold all by this; you hold it from the King of Kings, and your quit-rent, your acknowledgement for his great Mercy, is your Mercy to others; pay it down, or you have made a forfeiture of all; if you be Mercileſſe, all that labour (as 'tis called) of charity is loſt; your loud profeſſion, your forced gravity, your burning zeal, your faith alſo is vain, and you are yet in your ſinnes. For what are all theſe without Mercy but words and names? and there is no name by which we can be ſaved, but the name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and all theſe, Devotion, Confeſſion, Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, Zeal, Severity of life, are as it were the letters of his name, and I am ſure Mercy is one, and of a faire character; and if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punge and blot it out, it is not his name. Why boaſt we of our zeal? without mercy it is a conſuming fire.

When he ſits in judgement, humility gives the ſentence; when he trafficks, humility makes the bargain; when he caſts his bread upon the waters, his hand is guided by humility; when he bowes and falls down before his God, humility conceives the prayer; when he faſts, humility is <hi>in Capite Iejunii,</hi> and begins the faſt; when he exhorts, humility breaths it forth; when he inſtructs, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility dictates; when he corrects, humility makes the rod: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he doth, he does as before, or under, or with the Lord: hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

Epict.</note> is ſoon writ in any mans heart; and it is the office and work of humility to wipe it out, to wipe out all imaginations which riſe and ſwell againſt the Law, our neighbour, and ſo againſt God himſelf. For the mind of man is very ſubject to theſe fits of ſwelling; humility? our very nature riſeth at the mention of it. <hi>Habet mens noſtra ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime quiddam, &amp; impatiens ſuperioris,</hi> ſaith the Orator; mens minds naturally are lifted up, and cannot endure to be overlookt. Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity? 'Tis well we can heare her named with patience; it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, that we can commend her: but, <hi>quale monſtrum? quale ſacrilegium?</hi> ſaith the Father; O monſtrous ſacriledg! we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend humility, and that we do ſo, ſwells us; we ſhut her out of doores, when we entertain her; when we deck her with praiſes, we ſacrilegiouſly ſpoile her, and even loſe her in our Panegyricks and commendations. We ſee (for it is but too viſible) what light materialls we are made of, what tinder we are, that the leaſt ſpark will ſet us on fire, to blaze and be offenſive to every eye. We cenſure pride in others, and are proud we do ſo; we humble our brethren, and exalt our ſelves. It is the art and malice of the world, when men excell either in virtue or learning, to ſay, they are proud, and they think weith that breath to levell every hill that
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:59296:350"/> riſeth ſo high, and calls ſo many eyes to look upon it: But ſuppoſe they were; alas, a very fool will be ſo, and he that hath not one good part to gain the opinion of men, will do that office for himſelf, and wonder the world ſhould ſo miſtake him. Doth learning, or virtue, do our good parts puff us up, and ſet us in our Altitudes? No great matter, the wagging of a feather, the gingling of a ſpur, a little ceruſe and paint, any thing, nothing will do it. Nay, to deſcend yet lower, That which is worſe then nothing will do it; wickedneſſe will do it: <hi>He boaſteth of his hearts deſire,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſ.</hi> 10.3. he bleſſeth himſelf in evil; <hi>he rejoyceth in evil,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 2.14. he pleaſeth and flattereth himſelf in miſchif: And what are theſe benedictions, theſe boaſtings, theſe triumphs in evil, but as the breathings, the ſparkles, the proclamations of pride? <hi>The wicked is ſo proud, he careth not for God, he is not in all his waies.</hi> When <hi>Adam</hi> by pride was riſen ſo high as to fall from his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, God looks upon him in this his exaltation, or rather in this ruine, and beholds him not as his creature, but as a prodigie, and ſeemes to put on admiration; <hi>Ecce! Adam factus tanquam unus è nobis; See, the man is become like unto us,</hi> and he ſpeaks it by an Irony. A God he is, but of his own making; whileſt he was what I made him, he was a man, but Innocent, Juſt, immortall, of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar endowments, and he was ſo truly and really; but now having ſwelled, and reach'd beyond his bounds, a God he is, but <hi>per my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteriſmum,</hi> a God that may be pitied, that may be derided, a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, dying God, a God that will run into a thicket to hide himſelf: His greatneſſe is but figurative, but his miſery is reall; being turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of Paradiſe, hath nothing left but his fancy to Deifie him. This is our caſe, and our Teeth are on edge with the ſame ſowre grapes: we are proud, and ſinne, and are proud in our ſinnes: we lift up our ſelves againſt the Law, and when we have broke it, we lift up our ſelves againſt repentance: when we are weak, then we are ſtrong; when we are poor and miſerable, then we are rich; when we are naked, then we clothe our ſelves with pride as with a garment; and as in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo in us, our greatneſſe is but a tale, a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing lye, our ſins and imperfections true and reall; our Heaven but a thought, and our hell, burning: a ſtrange ſoloeciſme; a look as high as heaven, and the ſoule as low as the loweſt pit. It was an uſuall ſpeech with <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> That <hi>every man was born with a Pope in his belly;</hi> &amp; we know what the Pope hath long challeng'd and appropriated to himſelf, <hi>Infallibility</hi> &amp; <hi>Supremacy,</hi> which like the two ſides of an Arch mutually uphold each other: for doe we queſtion his Immunity from Errour? it is a bold errour in us; for he is ſupreme Judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies. And the Conjecture is eaſie which way the queſtion will be ſtated. Can we not be perſwaded and yield to his ſupremacy? then his Paraſites will tell you that he is Infallible; by this we may well gueſſe what <hi>Luther</hi> meant; for ſo it is in us, Pride makes us
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:59296:350"/> incorrigible, and the thought that we are ſo increaſeth our pride: we are too high to ſtand, and too wiſe to be wary; too learned to be taught, and too good to be reproved: we now ſtand upon our ſupremacy, ſee, how the worme ſwells into an Angel: The heart forgets it is fleſh, and becomes <hi>a</hi> ſtone; and you cannot ſet Chriſts Impreſſe, <hi>Humility,</hi> upon a ſtone. <hi>Learne of me, for I am humble;</hi> The eare is deafe, and the heart ſtubborne; the mind <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

                  <p>Now the office of humility is to abate this ſwelling; Its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per work is to <hi>hammer this rock, and break it to pieces, Jer.</hi> 23.29. to drive it into it ſelf, to pull it down at the ſight of this <hi>Lord,</hi> to place it under it ſelf, under the Law, under God; to bind it as it were with cords, and let out this corrupt blood, and this noxious humour, and ſo ſacrifice it to that God that framed it. In a word, depreſſing it in it ſelf, that it be not too wiſe, too full; That it may behold it ſelf of more value then the whole world, and then ſhut it ſelf up, that it wander not abroad after thoſe vanities which will ſoon fill it with aire, and ſwell it. This is the method, and this is the work of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; It pulls out our eyes, that we may ſee; ſpoiles us of our wealth, that we may be rich; takes us out the raies, that we may have light; takes us from our ſelves, that we may poſſeſſe our ſelves; bids us depart from God, that we may enjoy him. This is <hi>Janitrix ſcholae Chriſti,</hi> faith <hi>Bernard;</hi> for when we bow, and lye proſtrate, we are let in. This is as Saint <hi>John Baptiſt to prepare the way,</hi> to make every mountain low, and the rough places plaine; to depreſſe a lofty head, and ſink a haughty eye, and beat down a ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling heart. In a word, this is the beſt <hi>Leveller</hi> in the world, and there need none but this.</p>
                  <p>Wee ſee then in what humility conſiſts; in placing us where we ſhould be, at the footſtool of God, admiring his majeſty, and abhorring themſelves, diſtruſting our ſelves, and relying on his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, bowing to him when he helps us, and bowing to him when he ſtrikes us; denying ourſelves, ſurrendring our ſelves, being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in our ſelves, and all things in him. Which will more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare in the extent of this duty, which reacheth the whole man, both body and ſoul.

I know not how, good duties are either ſhrunk up in the conveyance, not drove home by the Maſters of the Aſſembly, or elſe taken into pieces in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.

If we can conceive an Humiliation, and draw forth its picture but in our fancy; nay if we can but ſay, <hi>It is good to be humbled,</hi> it is enough, though it be a lye, and we ſpeak not what we think.

And thus we divide Humility, nay thus we divide our ſelves from our ſelves, our ſoules from our bodies; either our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is ſo ſpirituall that we cannot ſee it, neither dropping at the eyes, nor changing the countenance, nor bowing the knees; nor
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:59296:351"/> heare it in complaints, and grones, and roarings, which were wont to be the language of humility; or ſo corporeall, that we ſee it all. God hath his part, and but a part, and ſo hath none; and then the conjecture is eaſie, who hath it all.</p>
                  <p>But our ſelves include both; neither is my Body my ſelf, nor my Soul my ſelf, but I am one made up of both, the knot that tyes them both together; and my Humility laſts no longer then whilſt I am one of both. Whilſt then we are ſo, let us give him both, and firſt the Soule. For there is no vice ſo dangerous, or to which we are more ſubject, then ſpirituall pride. Other vices proceed from ſome defect in us, or ſome ſinfull imbecillity of nature, but this many times ariſeth out of our good parts; Others fly from the preſence of God, this dares him to his face, and makes even Ruine it ſelf the Foundation of its Tabernacle. <hi>Inteſtinum malum periculoſius,</hi> The more neere the evil cleaves to the ſoule, the more dangerous it is; the more inward, the more fatall. I may wean my ſelf from the world, and fling off vanity; I may take off my ſoul from ſenſible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; I may deny my appetite, I may ſhut up my eye, I may bind my hands; I may ſtudy pleaſure ſo long, till I truly underſtand it, and know it is but madneſſe; and the world, till I contemn it; but Pride <hi>ultima exuitur,</hi> is the laſt garment which we put off; when we are naked, we can keep her on; and when we can be nothing we can be proud. And therefore ſome have conceived humility to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the ſoul as a Canopy covering and ſhadowing both the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, binding and moderating the underſtanding, and ſubduing the will; and whileſt they ſit under humility, they ſit in ſtate; the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is crowned with raies and light, and the will commands juſt things, as from its Throne; never imploys the eye or hand in any office for which the one ſhould be pluckt out, and the other cut off, but are both in their higheſt exaltation, being both now under the will of God. Our underſtanding many times walks in things too high for it, yet thinks ſhe is above them; and our will inclines (and that too oft) to things forbidden, becauſe they are ſo; cannot endure the check and reſtraint of a command, which it breaks under that name; the two greateſt evils under the Sunne, we are too wiſe, and we are too willfull. Now the pride of our will is quickly ſeen, and therefore the more curable; It ſhewes it ſelf in the wild irregular motions of the outward man; If lifts up the hand, it moves the tongue, it rowles the eye, it paints it ſelf upon the very countenance, either in ſmiles or frownes, either in cheerfulneſſe or terror; It is viſible in each motion, and there be Lawes to check and curb it, that it may not be ſo troubleſome and deſtructive as otherwiſe it would be; but <hi>quae latent nocent,</hi> The ſerpent at the heele, an over-weening conceit of our own knowledge, of our own perfections, how inviſible doth it enter us? how deceitfully doth it
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:59296:352"/> flatter us? how ſubtilly enſnare us? <hi>Benè ſapimus in cauſa noſtra,</hi> we are wiſe in our own cauſe; we have dig'd deep and found the truth, which others do but talk of; we cannot be deceived, and the thought that we cannot be deceived, doth deceive us moſt. Now we are rich, now we are learned, now we are wiſe, now we <hi>reigne as kings,</hi> and carry all before us; we controll the weak with our power; the ignorant with our knowledge; the poore with our wealth; the ſimple with our wiſdome; and confute our ſelves with our own arguments, and are poore, becauſe we are ſo rich; are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, becauſe we are ſo wiſe; can do little, becauſe we can do ſo much; and manifeſt our folly unto all men, becauſe we are ſo wiſe. For whither will this high conceit of our ſelves lift us? even above our ſelves, beſides our ſelves, againſt our ſelves: for whereſoever we ſtand, we ſtand a contradiction to our ſelves and others, and are as far from what we would ſet up, as they are, who would ſet up ſomething elſe which is nothing like it. We conceive the world is ſhaken and out of order, and we put forth our hand to beare up the pillars of it. We form Common-wealths, we ſquare out one by another, and know the dimenſions of neither. We modell Churches, draw out their Government, that is, <hi>make a coat for the moon:</hi> we make a Church, and clothe it with our fancy; fit it with a government, as with a garment, which will never be put on; or if it be, The next <hi>power</hi> may pluck it off, and leave it naked, leave it nothing, or put on ſome other which may be worne with more honour and ſafety to that power, which put it on. This is viſible and open to the eye, and that eye is but weak and dull which doth not ſee and obſerve it; why ſhould then our pride and ſelf-conceit thus walk as in ſhadow, as in a dreame? why ſhould we thus diſquiet our ſelves in vaine, and buſie our ſelves, and trouble others, to build up that to which we can contribute no more, then a poore, feeble wiſh, which hath not power enough to raiſe it to that deſired height in which we would have it ſeen, but will leave it where it was firſt ſet up (an uſeleſſe unregarded thing) in our brain and imagination? Chriſt and his Apoſtles did not leave the Church naked, but fitted her with a garment, which ſhe wore for many ages; in which there were ſcarce any that did ſtand up and ſay, <hi>It did not become her;</hi> and if we do not now like the faſhion, but ſit down and invent another, we do but teach and prompt others to do the like; and ſo we ſhall have many more, and none at all, be ever chuſing, ever changing, even to the end of the world. This is it which hath divided Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which have but one name, and given them ſo many, that it will coſt us labour and ſtudy but to number them: This rends the Church with Schiſme; for men that will not be confined, are ever asking how they ſhould be governed; and they are buſieſt to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the preſent form of diſcipline, who would have none: and if you obſerve the behaviour of the Schiſmatick, you may behold him
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:59296:352"/> walk, as if he had the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> on his breaſt, the breaſt-plate of judgement ever with him, for by a thought (which is but a look of the mind) he diſcovers, and determines all things; ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous is this ſpirituall pride both to our ſelves and others. Nor is the high conceit of our own perfections and holineſſe leſſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but moſt fatall to our ſelves; For that he aven which we draw out in our fancy, hath no more light and joy in it, then the region of darkneſſe; onely what is wanting in reality, we ſupply with thought; but to no more purpoſe then that ſouldier, who having no other pillow to lay his head on but his head-piece, that he might make it more eaſie, filled it with chaffe. <hi>We think our ſelves to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. <hi>and we are nothing, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;</hi> pride is but a thought, and pride is folly; now we are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

Oh beloved, the time was when men did ſo walk, as if God had been viſible and before them; The time was when Humility was thought a vertue; when Humility came forth in this dreſſe, <hi>multo deformata pulvere,</hi> with aſhes ſprinkled on her head, her garments rent, like a Penitentiary: You might have beheld her kiſſing the chains of impriſon'd Martyrs, waſhing the feet of Lazars, wallowing at the Temple doores, begging the prayers of the Saints; you might have ſeen her rent, and torn, ſtript and naked, the haire neglected, the eye hollow, the body withered, the feet bare, and the knees of horn, as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> deſcribes it in his 12. Oration. Then we humility not ſunk into the ſoul, but written and engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the body in Capitall letters, that you might have run and read it. But, I know not how the Face of Chriſtendome is much altered, and humility grown ſtately, hath bracelets on her Armes, and rich Diamonds on her Head: we have fed her daintily, and ſet her upon her feet. <hi>Walk humbly;</hi> that we can without hat or knee, with a merry and lofty countenance, with a face ſet by our Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and even ſpeaking our Pride and Scorn; and we appeare in the ſervice of God, as in a thing below us and which we Honour with our Preſence: Humility with an Humble look, a bowed knee, a Bare Head, a Compoſed Countenance? away with it, It is Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Superſtition. But let us not deceive our ſelves; God hates the viſor of humility, but not her face; If ſhe borrow from art and the pencill, ſhe is deformed, but appearing in her own likeneſſe, in that dreſſe; which God himſelf hath put her in, ſhe is lovely, and ſhines upon thoſe duties in which we are imployed, and makes them ſo delightfull to behold. 'Tis true, the thought may knock at heaven, when the body is on the ground; and when that's ſhut up between two walls, may meaſure out a Kingdome; and the whole world may be too narrow for an Anchoret: but it is as true, That humility never ſeized on the mind, but it draws the body after it; If I loſe my friend, my look will tell you he is gone. If a robber ſpoil all that I have, there is a kind of devaſtation of the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but a wounded ſpirit who can beare? If thy ſoul be truly humble, <hi>thy bones will conſume, and thy marrow waſte,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, Thy eye wax old, <hi>and thou wilt forget to eat thy bread;</hi> thou wilt goe <hi>heavily all the day long.</hi> Think what we will, pretend what we can, flatter our ſelves as we pleaſe, I ſhall aſſoone believe him chaſt, whoſe eyes are full of Adulteries, or who will ſell a copyhold to buy <hi>Aretines</hi> pictures; I ſhall as ſoon think him modeſt, whoſe mouth is an open ſepulchre; him charitable, who will ſooner eat up
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:59296:353"/> twenty poore men, then feed one, as that man devote and humble in his heart, who is ſo bold and irreverent in his outward geſture.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but look upon it as upon an impoſſibility, to draw theſe two together, a neglectfull deportment, and humility; for I cannot imagine, nor can any man give me a reaſon, why every. Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, nay, why every vice ſhould ſhew it ſelf in the outward man, <hi>totâ corpulentiâ,</hi> as the Father ſpeaks, in its full proportion and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions; That Anger ſhould ſhake the lips, and ſet the teeth, and dye the face ſometimes with white ſometimes with red; that ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſhould make men put on ſackcloth, rend their garments, beat their heads againſt the walls, as <hi>Auguſtus</hi> did for the defeat and loſſe of <hi>Varus;</hi> that even diſſimulation it ſelf ſhould betray it ſelf <hi>by the winking of the eye, Prov.</hi> 10.10. That every vice and virtue ſhould one way or other open it ſelf, and even ſpeak to the eye, onely De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and Humility ſhould ſink in, and withdraw it ſelf, lurke and lye hid in the inward man, as if it were aſhamed to ſhew its head; that we ſhould be afraid, to kneel, afraid, to be reverent; that it ſhould be a ſinne to kneel, a ſin to be humble; that to come and fall down, or bow, though it be in the houſe of God, is to worſhip <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.</hi> Reaſon and Religion help us, and deſtroy every Altar, and break down every image, and burn it with fire, and chaſe and baniſh all ſuperſtition from the face of the earth. <hi>And let all the people ſay Amen.</hi> But, God forbid, that reverence, and thoſe motions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of humility which are the works and language of the heart, ſhould be ſwept out together with the rubbiſh; that the wind which drives out ſuperſtition, ſhould leave an open way for Profaneneſſe and Atheiſme to enter in. <hi>And let all the people ſay Amen</hi> to that too. For if we do not preſent our bodies as well as our ſoules a <hi>living ſacrifice,</hi> glorifying God in every motion of it, as as we do in every conception of our mind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. Our ſervice cannot be a <hi>reaſonable ſervice of him,</hi> and the ſame tempeſt may drive down before it religion and reaſon both. S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath joyned them both together as in the purchaſe, ſo alſo in the obligation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Ye are bought with a price,</hi> This is the <hi>Antecedent;</hi> and then it follows neceſſarily, <hi>therefore glorifie God in your bodies and your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which are Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this may ſeem too generall; yet if we know what humility is, we ſhall the better ſee how <hi>to walk humbly with our God;</hi> but we will draw it neerer, and be more particular. And indeed, <hi>to walk humbly with our God, and to walk before him, Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>to walk in his ſtatutes, Pſal.</hi> 119.1. to walk in <hi>the light of the Lord, Iſ.</hi> 2.5. to walk as in his ſight, differ not in ſignification, nor preſent unto our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings diverſe things. For all ſpeake but this, to walk as in his preſence, to walk as if he were a neer ſpectator, as if he were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:59296:354"/> before us, not to ſhroud and mantle our ſelves, not to run into the thicket, as if there he could not ſee us; but ſo to behave our ſelves, as if he were a ſtander by, an eye-witneſſe of all our Actions; to curb our fancy, keep our tongue, be afraid of every Action, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this certain perſwaſion, That <hi>God is at hand.</hi> For as God is <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi> God with us, when he bleſſeth us and doth us good, ſo do we walk with God when we bleſſe him, and do our duties. <hi>As I was with Moſes, ſo will I be with thee,</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Joſhuah, Joſhuah.</hi> 5. Then God is with us when he ſtrengthneth our hands, when he ſhadows us under his wing, when he poureth forth his graces upon us; and then we <hi>walk with him</hi> when we bowe before him, uſe all the faculties of our ſoules, and move every member of our bodies as his, and as in his ſight; when we devote our ſelves to him alone; when our eye looks upon him <hi>as the eye of the handmaid on the eye of her miſtreſs,</hi> and by a ſtrict and ſincere obedience we follow him in all thoſe waies which he hath appointed for us.</p>
                  <p>This I take to be the meaning of the words; we ſhall draw all within the compaſſe of theſe conſiderations; firſt, That God <hi>hath an all-ſeeing eye,</hi> That he ſees all <hi>ad Nudum,</hi> as the Schooles ſpeak, naked as they are, ſurveys our Actions, heares our words, and ſearcheth the very inwards of the heart: ſecondly, That truly to believe this is the beſt preſervative of the other two; the beſt meanes to eſtabliſh Juſtice, and uphold Mercy in us; to keep us in an even and unerring courſe of obedience: for will any man of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his God in his very eye? And in the third place, we ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and point out thoſe who do not thus walk with God, but walk in the haughtineſſe, and deceitfulneſſe of their hearts, as if God had neither eye to ſee, nor eare to heare, nor hand to puniſh them, that we may mark and avoid them; and this ſhall ſerve for uſe and application. What doth God require?</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>—to walk humbly with thy God.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>And firſt, That we may walk humbly with our God, this muſt be laid as a foundation to build upon, as the <hi>primum movens,</hi> as the which firſt ſets us a walking, and puts us into this carefull and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble poſture, That God is preſent every where, and ſeeth and knoweth all things. And here we muſt not make too curious and bold a diſquiſition concerning the manner how God is preſent eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, and how he ſeeth all things; It is enough for us to believe he doth ſo, and not to ſeek to know that which he never told us, and which indeed he cannot tell us, becauſe we cannot apprehend it: for how can we receive that knowledge, of which we are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? we read, <hi>That he filleth the earth and the heaven, Jer.</hi> 23.24. <hi>That heaven is his Throne, and the earth his footſtoole, Iſ.</hi> 66.1. <hi>That he is higher then heaven, and deeper then hell, and longer then the earth, and broader then the ſea, Job</hi> 11.7,8,9. <hi>That he is not far from every
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:59296:354"/> one of us, That in him we live, and move, and have our being. Acts</hi> 17.27,28. That his underſtanding is infinite, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.5. That there is no creature which is not manifeſt in his ſight; <hi>that all things are naked to him,</hi>

                     </gap>, <hi>open as the</hi> entrailes of a beaſt cut down in the back, for ſacrifice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. <hi>That he looks down from heaven on the children of men. Pſal.</hi> 142. That his eyes are open upon all their waies; That neither they, nor their <hi>Imquity are hid from his face; &amp; hoc ſatis eſt dixiſſe Deo</hi>—and this is enough for God to tell us, and this is enough for us to know. I dare be bold to ſay, ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine, Forſitan nec ipſe Johannes dicit de Deo, ut eſt,</hi> Saint <hi>John</hi> was as an eagle, and flew aloft, to a higher pitch then the reſt, but could not ſoare ſo high as to bring us down a full relation, and tell us what God is. This is a meſſage which no man can bring, nor no man can heare. He was a man inſpired from God himſelf; if he had not been inſpired, he could have ſaid but little, and being a man, he could ſay no more. They that walk in valleys and in low places, ſee not much more ground then they tread; they that are in deep wells, ſee onely that part of the world which is over their heads; but he that is on the top of ſome exceeding high mountain, ſees all the levell, even the whole country which is about him: So it ſtands betwixt us mortalls and our incomprehenſible God; we that live in this world, are confined as it were into a valley or pit, we ſee no more then the bounds which are ſet us will give us leave; and that which our ſcant, and narrow wiſdome, and providence foreſees, when the eye thereof is cleereſt, is ful of uncertainty, as depending upon cauſes which may not work, or if they do, by the intervening of ſome croſſe accident, may faile. But God, who is that ſupreme and ſublime light, and by reaſon of his wonderfull nature ſo high exalted, as from ſome exceeding high mountain ſees all men at once, all Actions, all Caſualties preſent and to come, and with one caſt of his eye meaſures them all. This we are told, and 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for us that God hath told us ſo much; that he is in heaven, and yet not confined to that place; that he is every where, though we do not know how; that he ſees all things, knows all things; that he is Juſt, and wiſe, and Omnipotent: and here we may walk with ſafety, for the ground is firm under us; upon this we may build up our ſelves in our Holy Faith; upon this we may build up our <hi>Love,</hi> which alwaies eyes him; our honour to him, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bowes before him; our patience, which beares every burden, as if we ſaw him laying it on; our feare, to which every place is as mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> where it trembles before him; our hope, which layes hold on him, as if he were preſent in all the hardſhip we undergoe; our obedience, which alwaies works as in his eye; to venture fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is to venture as <hi>Peter</hi> did upon the Sea, where we are ſure to ſink; nor will Chriſt reach out his hand to help us, but we ſhall be ſwallowed up in that depth which hath no bottome, and be loſt in
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:59296:355"/> that which is paſt finding out; for this is the juſt puniſhment of our bold, and too forward curioſity; It works on buſily, and preſſeth forward with great earneſtneſſe to ſee it ſelf defeated; loſeth that which it might graſp, and findeth nothing.</p>
                  <p>It is enough for us to ſee the back parts of God, that is, as much as he is pleaſed to ſhew us; and the want of this moderation hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned many groſſe errours in the Church of Chriſt (for what can curioſity bring forth but monſters?) The <hi>Anomaei</hi> thought God as comprehenſible as themſelves (and indeed, upon a ſlender ſtock of knowledge we grow wanton, and talk of God as we do of one another) and no marvel, that they who know not themſelves ſhould be ſo ignorant of God, as to think to comprehend him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> wrote. The <hi>Manichees</hi> confined him to a place, and theſe Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> confutes. Others took upon them to qualifie and reforme this ſpeech, <hi>God is in every place,</hi> by changing the prepoſition <hi>In</hi> into <hi>Cum,</hi> God is with every place. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers conclude that the eſſence of God is moſt properly in heaven; others have ſhut him up there, and excluded his preſence from this lower world. The <hi>heaven,</hi> they will tell you, <hi>is his Throne,</hi> but then is not the earth <hi>alſo his footſtoole;</hi> why may he not then be in earth, as well as in heaven? For the Argument is the very ſame; nor muſt we conceive of God as we do of great Potentates, whom we do not entertain in a Cottage, but in a Palace; nor can his Majeſty gather ſoyl by intermingling it ſelf with the things of the earth (a moſt carnall conceit) for the very Poet will tell us, <hi>Tangere &amp; tangi niſi cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus nulla poteſt res.</hi> That nothing but a body can be touch'd, much leſſe defiled. We cannot think the Angel impaired his beauty by being in priſon with <hi>Peter,</hi> or in the den with <hi>Daniel,</hi> unleſſe we will ſay he was ſcorch't in the furnace, when the three men did not ſo much as ſmell of the fire. <hi>The heavens themſelves are unclean in his ſight,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> c. 15. yet he remains, ſaith the Father, pure <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

                     </gap>, in a moſt wonderfull exuberance, beyond all Hyperbole; No pitch can defile him, no ſinne pollute him; No deformity on earth can ſully his beauty. Our curſed oathes do even blaſt his name, yet his name is the ſame, <hi>the Holy of Holyes;</hi> his eyes beheld us weltring in our blood, yet they are ten thouſand times brighter then the ſunne; and therefore he is truly called <hi>Actus primus,</hi> an act or eſſence, as free from contagion, as compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We take perfection from, him he receives no imperfection from us; he ſits in heaven, yet his Majeſty is not increaſed; he walks on the earth, yet his Majeſty is not diminiſhed; he rides on the wings of the wind, yet his Majeſty and glory is ſtill the ſame. He is in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, makes darkneſſe a Pavillion round about him, yet is light it ſelf; he is in our corrupt hearts, yet is purity it ſelf. <hi>Nuſquam eſt, &amp; ubique eſt,</hi> he is no where, becauſe no place can contain him; he
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:59296:355"/> is every where, becauſe no body, no place, no ſubſtance whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can exclude him. And as he is preſent with us, and about our paths, ſo he ſees and knows every motion and action of ours. Our inclinations, our thoughts, when they are riſen, whileſt they were ariſing, before there was either object or opportunity to raiſe them, or any temptation to draw them up. He ſees our habits, our vices and virtues, before we ventured on that action which did lead the way and begin them; <hi>I know him,</hi> ſaith God of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18.19. and that he will do <hi>Juſtice and Judgement.</hi> He knows our <hi>diſpoſitions. And found ſome good thing in Jeroboams child,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.13. He ſees all our actions long before they are done; our thoughts, before they are conceived; our deliberations, before we ask counſel; and our counſels, before they are fixt. Of what large extent were many of the propheſies? how many yeares? how many croſſe actions? how many contingencies? what numberleſſe ſwarms of thoughts inconſiſtent, and not underſtood, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current and introductory to that which was foretold, came between the propheſie and the fullfilling of it? yet God ſaw through all theſe, and ſaw all theſe, and how they were working to that end, of which he was pleaſed to give the prophets a ſight. The prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> foretells the ſucceſſion of the Monarchies, the diviſion of <hi>Alexanders</hi> kingdomes, the ruine of the Jews, and that ſo plainly, that <hi>Prophyry,</hi> a great enemy to the Chriſtians, to diſgrace and put it off, ſaid, That it was a diſcourſe much like <hi>Lycophrons Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandra,</hi> written after the things were done, and ſo publiſht to caiol and deceive the people, who are ſoon pleaſed, &amp; ſo, ſoon taken with a cheat. <hi>Malè nôrunt Deum, qui non putant illum poſſe quod non putant,</hi>

He that faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the heart, ſhall not he conſider all our works? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.15. He ſees us when we fall down before him, he ſees us when we harden our faces; and he ſees us in our teares, and he ſees us in our blood, and yet he remaines yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame for ever. For as it is an argument of his infinite perfection to underſtand all things, ſo is it of his Judiciary and infinite power to ſee, and know, and obſerve thoſe motions, thoſe offers, thoſe inclinations which are againſt his Law, and by which we are ſaid to fight againſt him. I may know Adultery, and yet be chaſt; I may ſee malice and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate in the City, and yet be peaceable; I may heare blaſphemy, and yet tremble at Gods name: For ſinne doth not pollute as it is in the underſtanding, but in the will; not as it is known, but as it is embraced; and not by any phyſicall, but a morall contagion, which firſt infects the will alone. If the bare knowledge of evil could pollute, then he that makes himſelf an Eunuch for the kingdome
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:59296:356"/> of heaven, may be an Adulterer, and the Judge that ſits to condemn the ſinne, may be a Parricide.</p>
                  <p>God then may be preſent every where, and this is the pooreſt exception that can be made againſt it. I have waved, you ſee, that more ſubtile and intricate diſputes, (and there be too many, for men are never weary of doing nothing) that which hath been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken is as plain as neceſſary, and no man can take it as a thing out of his ſphere and reach. Let us paſſe to that which we propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the ſecond place, and for which we propoſed this of the Omnipreſence and Omniſcience of God. For the conſideration of this is the beſt preſervative of Mercy, and Pillar to uphold Juſtice; <hi>Septum Legis,</hi> a fence, a hedge ſet about the Law, that no unclean beaſt be ſo bold to break in, and come ſo neer as to touch it. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> makes this uſe of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7. <hi>Quò ibo à ſpiritu? whither ſhall I go from thy ſpirit, or whither ſhall I fly from thy preſence? If I go into heaven, thou art there; If I make my bed in hell, behold thou art there; If I take the wings of the morning, and fly to the uttermoſt parts of the Sea, even there ſhalt thou find me out.</hi> Now nothing can be more forcible to make us walk reverently and humbly with our God, then a firm perſwaſion that God walks with us that he ſees and obſerves us, that whatever we do or think lyes open to the view and ſurvey of that all-ſeeing eye. For ſecreſie is the nurſe of ſinne; that is done often which is done without witneſſe, and done with more delight, in a kind of pride and triumph, where there is the leaſt feare of diſcovery.

                  <p>Again, though the Laws of men carry ſome terrour with them, yet as <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> ſpeaks of the low eſteem they of <hi>Vienna</hi> had of Excommunications, <hi>Tantum terrent quantum infamant, aut damno temporali ſunt,</hi> Their terror is no more, then the ſmart, and loſſe, and infamy they bring; and though they be <hi>ſurda res,</hi> deaf and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable, yet a Bribe will not onely blind the eyes, but change the countenance and voice of him that ſhould keep them; and this leaves them weak and invalid to prevent or remove thoſe irregularities which they threaten, but in vain, being in thoſe hands which are open for a bribe, and then bind them up. <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That the providence and authority of men in this doe pariate and are alike; ſuch as their wiſdome is to demonſtrate that which is good, ſuch is their power to exact it; <hi>Tam illa falli facilis, quàm iſta contemni,</hi>

When we walk under the Lawes of men, we walk as under a cloud, which every wind may carry about, and at laſt ſcatter and diſperſe; but when we walk under the Lawes of God, we walk as under heaven, the Throne of God, which ſhall ſtand faſt for ever; when we walk with men, we walk as with them whom we can ſometimes delude, ſometimes muzzle and bind; but when we walk with God, we walk with him who is every where, and ſees every event; whoſe eye is ever open, whoſe hand is ever ſtretched out, and whoſe voice breaketh the Cedars of <hi>Libanus.</hi>

                     </gap>, ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> beat and wound it more and more: <hi>multi famam, pauci conſcientiam verentur,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pliny,</hi> the loudeſt noiſe our conſcience can make is not heard, but the cenſure of men, which is not, moſt times worth our thought, is a thunder-clap; we heare it, and we tremble; we are led like fooles with melody to the ſtocks; what others ſay is our motion, and turnes us about to any point, but when we ſpeak to our ſelves we heare it, but believe it not, fling it by and forget it.
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:59296:357"/> The voice of conſcience is, <hi>defraud not your brother;</hi> nay, but we will over-reach him: the voice of conſcience is, <hi>Love thy neighbour as thy ſelf;</hi> nay, but we will oppreſſe him; the voice of conſcience is, <hi>Love Mercy;</hi> nay, but we will love our ſelves: what we ſpeak to our ſelves, our ſelves ſoon make hereticall. How Ambitious are we to be accounted Juſt, and how unwilling to be ſo? How loud are we againſt ſin in the preſence of others, and then make our ſelves as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible as we can that we may commit it? what a ſin is unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the Temple, and what a bleſſing is it in the cloſet? with what gravity and ſeverity will a corrupt Judge threaten iniquity? What? a pilferer? Let him be whipt. What? a murderer? He ſhall dye the death: he whips the theef, and hangs the murderer, and indeed whips and hangs himſelf by a Proxie. So that we ſee, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the power of the Laws, nor the reſpect and obedience we owe to our ſelves, are of any great force to prevaile with us to order our ſteps aright, walk with men, or as before men. That may have ſome force, but it reacheth no further then the outward man. Walk with our ſelves? give eare to our ſelves? This might do much more; but we ſee the practice of it is very rare and unuſuall; That there is little hope that it will compleat and perfect our walk, and make us Juſt and Mercifull men, which is here required. It will be eaſie then to infer, that our ſafeſt conduct will be to walk with God, and to ſecure both the Laws of men, and that Law within us; that they may have their full power and effect in us, we muſt firſt raiſe and build up in our ſelves this firm perſwaſion, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we do, or think, is open to the eye of that God who is above us, and yet with us; That that diſcovery which he makes is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely and incomparably more cleare and certain then that which we make by our ſences; that we do not ſee our friend ſo plain as he ſeeth our hearts; that thou ſeeſt not the birds fly in the ayre ſo diſtinctly as he ſees thy thoughts fly about the world, to thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall objects which we have ſet up for our delight; that he ſees, and obſerves that irregularity and deformity in our actions, which is hid from our eyes when our intention is ſerious, and our ſearch moſt accurate. Yet nevertheleſſe, though being as we are in the fleſh, and ſo led by ſence, were this belief rooted and confirmed in us, <hi>That he did but ſee us, as man ſees us</hi> or were this as evident to our faith, as that is to our ſence, we ſhould be more watchfull over our ſelves, more wary of the divels ſnares and baits then we commonly are; <hi>magna neceſsitas indicta pietatis, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith <hi>Hilary,</hi>

                  <p>And now in the laſt place; Let us caſt a look upon thoſe who for want of this perſwaſion, doe walk on in the haughtineſſe of their hearts, and neither bowe to the Laws of God or men, nor hearken to the Law within them; which notwithſtanding could not be in them, were not this bright Eye and powerfull Hand over them.

Thus it is in every bold preſumptuous ſinner even as it was with the Devil, <hi>Depuduit,</hi> no ſooner doe they caſt themſelves down from Heaven, but they caſt away all ſhame, and their modeſty flyes from them in the very fall, and their Motto is, <hi>Tuſh, God doth not ſee;</hi> And this ſure is not <hi>to walk with God,</hi> but to walk and ſtrut as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did in his Palace, <hi>This is the Palace which I have built:</hi> Thus, thus have I done, and who dares fling a ſtone at it? To walk as <hi>Goliah</hi> did, in a coat of Braſſe, and defie the Hoſt of Iſrael, and God himſelf. <hi>Golias in fronte, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin; Golias</hi> was ſmote in the forehead, and ſo are they. The diſeaſe indeed is in the heart, but it hath made an impreſſion, and left a mark in the forehead. He that hath forgot to bluſh, doth not well remember that there is a God who looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>
                  <p>Secondy, the diſſembling ſinner, the Hypocrite <hi>walks not with God:</hi> for he is but a Player of Religion, and being but a Slave, comes forth a King, and then treads his meaſures, puts it to the triall whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God hath an eye, whether he will take droſſe for ſilver, a <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies</hi> for a ſubſtance, a Faſt for Repentance, a picture for the new creature. <hi>Archidamus</hi> ſaid well of an old man, that had died and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured his haire, 'Tis not likely he ſhould ſpeak truth, <hi>qui menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium in capite circumfert,</hi> who carries about with him a lye on his head; nor can he walk as with his God, whoſe very ſpeech and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, whoſe very look is a lye. Where there are falſe lights there the ware is not warrantable; where there are privy doors, there the Prieſts will practiſe colluſion, and eat up the Idols meat. If you ſee a labyrinth, it is either to conceale a ſtrumpet or a Minotaure. That is true of the hypocrite which the Rabbies conceived of their Prieſts; <hi>He is like an Angel, viſible or inviſible as he pleaſe.</hi> Now this is not to walk with God, but to walk with our luſts, with our malice and Covetouſneſſe; to look upon them as we ſhould do upon our God, to be carefull that they are pleaſed and ſatisfied; to reverence them, to follow their beheſts and commands; to provide that theſe horſe-leaches be fed, our luſt fed with pleaſure, and our covetouſneſſe with gold; for theſe are the Hypocrites gods. As for the true God, they leave him behind them, and walk with nothing but his <hi>Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly: The Apologizing ſinner walks not with God, but
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:59296:359"/> runnes himſelf into the thicket of excuſes, <hi>Covers his tranſgreſsions as Adam, and hides his iniquity in his boſome, Job</hi> 31.33. Covers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf over with theſe leaves, which have no heat, no ſolidity in them, but will wither and dye when the Sun ſhews it ſelf, and be ſcattered before the wind, and leave him naked and miſerable. He hath learnt an art, (and he may quickly learne that of his ſinne, which needs and teacheth it) <hi>pavimentare peccata,</hi> (it is Saint <hi>Auſtins</hi> phraſe) to ſmooth or plaſter and parget over his deformities; he excuſes the breach of one commandment with his zeal to another; the breach of his charity, by his love to his faith: He excuſes ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by his hatred to Idolatry; his malice, by his zeal; he pleads ignorance where there is light enough, and weakneſſe when he might be ſtrong; and infirmity, where he preſumes; and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when he had no will; and will not conſider that the devil ſpeaks by all theſe, as he did to our firſt parents by the ſerpent; For <hi>this is no ſinne at all,</hi> and you <hi>ſhall not dye at all,</hi> are all one. He ſpeaks, ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> by the mathematician, <hi>That he ſinnes not, but his ſtarre.</hi> He ſpeaks by the Manichee, <hi>That he ſinnes not, but the Prince of Darkneſſe.</hi> I may add, he ſpeaks by the Anabaptiſt, 'Tis not he ſinnes, <hi>but the Aſſe his body;</hi> By the Libertine, <hi>That God ſins in him;</hi> and by the many, that the devil onely is in fault. If we look upon it well, and ſend our eye abroad into the world, we may peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be tempted to think, that the world and all that therein is, were onely made to yield matter out of which to forge and faſhion an excuſe; for what is there almoſt in the world which we do not lay hold on for that end? <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt man, is the firſt excuſe, and we drew it out of his loines: Originall ſinne, and after that the Law, the fleſh, the will, the underſtanding, ſinne, obedience, the devils, and God himſelf are forced in to ſpeak for us; and what was made the matter of virtue and obedience, is by us made the matter of excuſe; we may be bold to ſay, This is not <hi>to walk with God,</hi> as if he had an all-ſeeing eye, but to flutter up and down, as the Raven did upon the waters, from excuſe to excuſe, but far from God and the Arke; ſo to walk as if we were quite out of his reach and ſight.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all; The ſpeculative ſinner doth not walk with God, I meane, the man that breaks not out into action, but yet perfects his work in his mind; where the ſinner doth that which he never doth, joynes with that object which he ſhall never touch; commits adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and yet may be an Eunuch; plots revenge, and yet never ſtrikes a ſtroke; graſps the wealth which he will not labour for; marryes that beauty which he ſaw but once, and ſhall never ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and there acts over thoſe ſinnes which he ſhall never bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to act; delights in that which he ſhall never enjoy, and robs and ſlayes, and rides in triumph on a thought; and ſo leaves his God,
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:59296:359"/> who gave him this power and faculty to another end, and not to wallow in this mire, nor to be enſlaved to the drudgery of ſo vile an imployment; and yet too many are willing to perſwade themſelves, that God neither ſees it nor regards it; that a thought is ſuch <hi>Goza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi> of ſo thin an appearance, that it eſcapeth the eye, and ſo they ſet up a whole family of them in the mind, and dally and delight themſelves with them as with their children. And yet this is the ground of all evil, and evil it ſelf; wrought in the ſoul, which works by its faculties, as the body doth by its members, the eye and the hand; and thus it may beat down Temples, murder men, lay King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes levell with the ground, and it growes and multiplies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects upon it ſelf with joy and content, <hi>&amp; omnia habet peccatoris prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter manus,</hi> and hath all that makes a ſinner but hands; and though men ſee not our thoughts, (for this is a royall prerogative) yet they are viſible to his eye who is a ſpirit; and they that look upon them as bare and naked thoughts, and not as complete works fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht in the ſoul, know not themſelves, nor the Nature of God, and therefore canot be ſaid <hi>to walk with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude then: Theſe walk not with God, and let us mark and avoid them. The preſumptuous daring ſinner walks not with him, but hides himſelf in this Atheiſticall conceit, that becauſe man cannot puniſh, God doth not ſee. The hypocrite comes forth in a diſguiſe, and acts his part, and becauſe men applaud him, thinks God is of their mind; as the <hi>Pantomime</hi> in <hi>Seneca,</hi> who obſerving the people well pleaſed with his dancing, did every day go up into the Capitol, and dance before <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and was perſwaded that he was alſo delighted in him. The Apologizer runnes into the holes and burrowes of excuſes, and there he is ſafe; for who ſhall ſee him? The ſpeculative ſinner hides himſelf and all his thoughts in a thought, is this thought, that thoughts are ſo neer to nothing that they are inviſible; that ſin is not ſinfull, till it ſpeak with the tongue, or act with the hand. But the eye of God is brighter then the Sun, and <hi>his eye-lids</hi> will try the children of men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. as the gold-ſmith tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his gold in the fire, and will find out the droſſe, which we do not ſee. And if we will not walk with him, <hi>but walk contrary unto him, Levit.</hi> 26.22. He will alſo <hi>walk contrary unto us;</hi> He will ſee us, and not ſee us; know us, and not know us. <note place="margin">

            <p>In this which I have read unto you, and choſen as the fitteſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for this preſent occaſion; The heart having looked abroad, having lookt out of it ſelf, and reflected back into it ſelf, drawes out in it ſelfe <hi>the picture of a ſtranger or a Pilgrime,</hi> and having well lookt upon it with the ſerious eye of contemplation (which is the heart of the heart, and the ſoul of the ſoul) having ſurveyed the place of its habitation, how fraile and ruinous it is, as a tent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the winds, and beat upon by every ſtorm, and at laſt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; it goes out of it ſelf, and ſeeks for ſhelter under the ſhadow of Gods wing, ſends forth ſtrong deſires for ſupply and ſupport; <hi>in hoc inquilinatûs ſui tempore,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks, in this time of its ſojourning and Pilgrimage; and for that ſupply which is moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the condition of a ſtranger upon earth, and which may beſt conduct him to the place for which he was born and bound. He asketh not for riches; they have wings and will fly away, and leave him in his walk, or if they ſtay with him they will but mock and delude him, and lead him out of his way; not for honour, that's but a breath, but aire, and may breath upon him at one ſtage, and at the next leave him, but never forward him in his way; not for delightfull vanities; theſe are but ill companions and will lead him out of his way: the beſt ſupply for a <hi>ſtranger</hi> here upon earth is from heaven; from the place not where he ſojournes, but to which he is going; the beſt convoy, the will and commandments of God; the word of God, the beſt <hi>lantern to his feet;</hi> for whileſt theſe are in his eye and heart, he ſhall paſſe by ſlippery places, and not fall; he ſhall paſſe through fire and water, he ſhall walk upon <hi>the Lion and the Aſpe,</hi> he ſhall meet with flattering objects, and loath them with terrorus, &amp; contemn them; uſe the world as if he uſed it not; in poverty, &amp; yet not poor; in affliction, but not diſtreſt; in many a ſtorm, and paſſe through, and rejoyce in it; living in the world, and yet dead in the world, and ſo make his way through the valley and ſhadow of death to his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes end, to that reſt which remaines for the people of God, who are but <hi>Strangers</hi> and <hi>Pilgrimes</hi> upon earth. This is the beſt ſupply, and for this the Prophet puts up his petition in the words of my text,
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:59296:361"/> 
               <hi>I am a ſtranger upon earth, hide not thy commandments from mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are the words of the Kingly Prophet, and in the thirty ninth Pſalme he hath the very ſame; <hi>Hold not thy peace at my teares, for I am a ſtranger with thee, and a ſojourner as all my Fathers were;</hi> and in them he preſents unto us his ſtate and condition, and in his own, of all mankind. <hi>Menander fecit Andriam &amp; Perinthiam,</hi> one man is the map of all mankind, and he that knows one knows them all. <hi>David</hi> was, and then all men are but <hi>accolae, inquilini,</hi> and howſoever their Pomp and Glory may dazle the eyes of men, yet if we will define them aright, and ſet them out as they are, they are but ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and <hi>Pilgrimes</hi> upon earth.</p>
            <p>So that we have here firſt, a doctrine; declaring what we are; <hi>we are but ſtrangers upon earth,</hi> that's our condition; he that is leaſt in it is ſo, and he that hath moſt and is Lord of it, is no more; ſecondly, the <hi>uſe</hi> or inference; <hi>hide not thy commandments from me.</hi> For he that hath one eye upon his frailty and defects, will have another upon a ſupply; he that knows himſelf a <hi>ſtranger</hi> will deſire a guide.</p>
            <p>Or you have <hi>our character,</hi> we are <hi>Accolae, ſtrangers;</hi> and our <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

               </gap> or <hi>viaticum,</hi> our proviſion in our way, the commandments of God.</p>
            <p>Or if you pleaſe you may conſider firſt the perſon, I, King <hi>David;</hi> ſecondly, his quality and condition, <hi>a King</hi> and yet a ſtranger on the earth; and theſe two draw together into one the two moſt different ſtates of the world, <hi>a powerfull Prince and a poor Pilgrime,</hi> him that ſits on the Throne, and him that grinds at the mill, the crowned head, and that head which hath not a hole to hide it ſelf. And thirdly, the reaſon why the Holy Ghoſt, to teach us our condition, doth make choice of a King; out of which we ſhall raiſe this doctrine, which is but a Paraphraſe of the text, firſt, that man by nature is but a ſtranger to the world; ſecondly, that he is to make himſelf ſo. And that you may, I muſt hold out to you your <hi>viaticum,</hi> your proviſion, <hi>the commandments of God,</hi> and ſhew you of what uſe they have been to you in this your peregrination and pilgrimage.

               </q> And firſt we muſt look on the perſon that ſpeaks, and we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure wonder that he ſpeaks it; that he who was as a God upon the earth, and one of thoſe whom God himſelfe calleth ſo, ſhould yet ſpeak in the low and humble language of a Lazar, and count himſelf a ſtranger. We may well think the character doth but ill befit him: It may ſeem rather to be the ſpeech of ſome one of the Rechabites, who by their Father <hi>Jonadab</hi> were forbad to <hi>build hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> to <hi>ſow ſeed,</hi> to <hi>plant vineyards, or to have any,</hi> but all their lives to
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:59296:362"/> live in Tents, <hi>Jer.</hi> 35.6,7. Or of ſome of the <hi>Eſſenes,</hi> a Sect amongſt the Jews, who left the City, and betook themſelves to Fields and Mountains, <note place="margin">Plin. Nat. Hiſt. <hi>l. 6.17.</hi>

This ſpeech had well befitted one of theſe; and had <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> or <hi>Tully</hi> been to draw the character of a <hi>ſtranger up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth,</hi> they would have brought him out of the ſtreets or high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, out of ſome Cell or Priſon, with all the marks about him; but their imagination would have paſſed by the Palaces of Princes, as yeelding nothing of him; For a King is but a nick-name, but a ſoloeciſme, if he be not at home in every place. But the holy Ghoſt regards not this Rhetorick, obſerves not this art, which indeed is made up but by the eye; his method is <hi>è chola Coeli,</hi> drawn out by that wiſdome which formed and faſhioned us, and knows whereof and what we are made; and that which fleſh and blood counts a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loeciſme, with him is the moſt exact propriety of language; what with us is lookt upon as that which is againſt the rules of art, with him is moſt regular. I may ſay, truth is the ſpirits art, and thoſe words which convey it are the beſt Elegancies; and thus to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this leſſon to us, he makes choice of a perſon to an eye of fleſh moſt unlikely, as <hi>Elias</hi> in the book of Kings takes water to kindle the fire upon the Lords Altar. A King on the earth and a <hi>ſtranger</hi> on the earth <hi>non benè convenient,</hi> and will hardly be coupled together in the ſame propoſition. For how can they be ſtrangers on earth, who are the onely Lords and proprietaries of it? Kings are <hi>Domini rerum temporumque,</hi> are Lords of the times, and of all affaires, and they carry all before them; this ſhall be the manner of the King, ſaith <hi>Samuel</hi> 1.7. <hi>He ſhall take your ſonnes and your daughters, and make them his ſervants. He ſhall take your fields and your vineyards, and turn them to his own uſe. A King;</hi> the very name ſtrikes a terrour in us, and puts out of the beſt eye we have, our reaſon, that we cannot diſcern between the King and the Man, nor the man and the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; that we judge of him by what he is: <hi>Si libet, licet,</hi> His will is his Law, and what he doth is juſt, or he will make it ſo, <hi>for who dares ſay what doeſt thou?</hi> And yet this King, this God, is but a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, take him in his zenith: take all his broad-blown glories, his ſwelling titles, his over-ſpreading power, and all are drawn together and ſhrunk up in this one word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

               </gap>, <hi>Accola;</hi> whatſoever he is, whatſoever he appeares, he is but a ſtranger. Behold here the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophet makes it his profeſſion, layes by the title of a King as guilty of a <hi>Miſnomer,</hi> and calls himſelf a Pilgrime; and as in the darkneſſe of Popery he that vowed a Pilgrimage either to our Lady,
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:59296:362"/> or ſome Saint, to <hi>Rome</hi> or to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> did preſent himſelf before the Altar, and then receive his Scrip and Staff. So am I here this day occaſioned by this Pilgrime, this honoured Knight, to exhort you to vow a Pilgrimage, not to this or that Saint, but to the King of Saints, and this you may do and ſtay at home; In your houſe and private cloſets this Pilgrimage is beſt vowed, for the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is as neere out of <hi>Brittany</hi> as <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and here you have a King to lead you, and his example to accompany you. For the words which I now read, doe as it were bring him to the Church, where he preſents himſelf before the Altar, layes down his Crown and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and takes as it were his ſcrip and his ſtaffe, and vows himſelf a Pilgrim.

               </note> becauſe the Scholars and Diſciples of Experience, <hi>Quam uſus genuit, &amp; mater peperit memoria,</hi> Begot by uſe and converſation in the world, and brought forth by memory. For thoſe Concluſions which we gain by evidence of Reaſon, may be as ſure, but not ſo operative and impreſſive as thoſe which are drawn out by frequent and ſenſible obſervation. Thoſe we behold as we doe our face in a glaſſe (as Saint <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks) and then goe away and forget them; and commonly they beget a knowledge which ends in it ſelf, and ſo becomes more fatall then Ignorance. But thoſe Leſſons which Experience brings us, doe leave a mark and impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion behind them, and even characterize the ſoul, and ſo fill it that it muſt vent and evaporate, diſcourſe to it ſelfe, and diſcourſe to others what it hath ſeen and felt; and it flows naturally and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly from the very depth of Apprehenſion. He makes the faireſt and the livelyeſt ſhew of a <hi>ſtranger,</hi> who ſhews him in purple and on the throne.

               </gap>, dip his pen in his mind, and then draw out thoſe concluſions which long and ſad experience hath taught him: For who fitter to declame againſt Riot, then he that hath fed with Swine? who can be a better Orator againſt Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, then he that hath found the deluſion of Wine, and the rage of Drink? who can diſgrace beauty more then he that hath felt it bite like a Cockatrice? when <hi>Dives</hi> was in hell, how ready was he to be a Preacher of righteouſneſſe to his brethren? Experience doth make men both willing and able Inſtructers. And certainly to caſt a ſlur on vanity, to decry the glory of the world, to teach the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of riches, and the folly of Ambition, to demonſtrate that there is no ſolid or laſting Joy to be founded on any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the moon, they can beſt do who have had experience, and are
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:59296:363"/> examples of both fortunes, who have wallowed in wealth, and been mockt by it; who have lain in pleaſure, and been ſtung; who have catcht at any evil that might carry them to that height they aimed at, and then been thrown down by the ſame evil that brought them up; who by long experience know what riches and Pleaſures are; what wings the one have, and what horrour the other leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them when they turn their back; who having had all their vain wiſhes made good, are brought at laſt to unwiſh and execrate them all, and forced to make this their laſt, that they had never had what they ſo much deſired. Never was the world more ſeverely cenſured then by thoſe who have made moſt triall of it. No theme more uſually handled by all ſorts, then that of the contempt of the world, <hi>nuſquam tamen humanum genus tam incredulum, tam ſurdum eſt,</hi> and yet who heares what himſelf ſayes? or who believes his own report? the greateſt part of men that ſpeak againſt it, do it not out of hatred, but out of love to the world; for who more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to pluck the purple robe off from the rich mans back, then he that longs to weare it himſelf? how greedily do men ſurfeit on that meat which their injuſtice hath pluckt out of the mouthes of others? <note place="margin">His inviſa ſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noratio quibus ſuccurrere vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur. <hi>Columel.</hi>
               </note> It is with the world as with money let out upon uſe, men hate and revile it, yet are willing and uſe all meanes to bring it into their hands, though upon the hard and ſo much loathed condition of intereſt. The Philoſophers have largely written of this ſubject, but moſt of that they wrote they wrote upon conjecture and gueſſe, and ſcarce believed themſelves in what they wrote; they have writ beſt who have been diſciplined by their own folly, and have been taught not by the beſt, but yet by the ſureſt miſtriſſe, experience; who have been ſo roughly handled in the waies which they choſe and delighted in, that at laſt they were even forced to that proficiencie, that they did indeed believe themſelves. <hi>Solomon,</hi> who was a King, &amp; wrote a bitter Satyre againſt the world, did firſt taſte the gall of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very vanity, and then he wrote more fully, more profitably, then ever yet any Philoſopher did in his cell; for having run over the whole work of the creation of the world, having watched the courſe of things, and every motion of his own heart; having been turned round as it were on the wheel of viciſſitude and change, at laſt ſettles and reſts upon this concluſion, which was drawn forth out of the full treaſurie of his experience: Firſt he thought in his heart of what he had ſeen; and then <hi>he ſaid in his heart,</hi> and fixt it up in laſting chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters to be read in the world to the end of it, That, all that was in it was vanity. And therefore when a King thus pronounceth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he is but a ſtranger, it muſt needs carry a far greater weight and argument of truth, then if a private unexperienced man had ſpoken it. <hi>David</hi> had experience of peace and war, of riches and poverty, of pleaſures and woe; He had been a private and publick perſon; a ſhepherd, a painfull calling; a ſouldier, a bloody trade; a
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:59296:363"/> courtier, an honourable ſlavery, which joynes together in one the Lord and the Paraſite; the Gentleman and the Drudg; and he was a King, a glorious name, filled up with feares and cares; all theſe he had paſſed through, and found leaſt reſt when he was at the higheſt, leſſe content in the Throne then in the ſheepfolds; all this he had obſerved and laid up in his memory, and this his confeſſion is an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitome and briefe of all; and in effect he tells us, that whatſoever he had ſeen in this his paſſage, whatſoever he had enjoyed, yet he found nothing ſo certain as this, that he had found nothing certain, nothing that he could abide with, or would abide with him, but was ſtill as a paſſenger, and ſtranger on the earth.</p>
            <p>Now (to give you a ſecond reaſon, why the ſpirit of God makes choice of a King to preach this leſſon) as he chuſeth the beſt and moſt experienced maſters, ſo doth he condeſcend, and indulge to our infirmity, and appoints the fitteſt for us, and thoſe of whom we will ſooneſt learn; whoſe firſt queſtion commonly is, <hi>who is the Preacher?</hi> who deliver up our judgements to our affections, and converſe rather with mens fortunes then their perſons, and make uſe of no other rule in our cenſure of <hi>what</hi> is <hi>done</hi> or <hi>ſaid,</hi> then the man himſelf that did or ſpake it: if honour, or power, or wealth have made the man great in our eyes, then whatſoever he ſpeaks is an Oracle, though it be the <hi>doctrine of devils,</hi> and have the ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which all other lyes have. Truth doth ſeldome goe down with us, unleſſe it be preſented in the cup in which we love to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and propheſie. <hi>There was a poor wiſe man found,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, that delivered the City by his wiſdome, Eccleſ.</hi> 9.15. <hi>but none remembred or conſidered this poor wiſe man.</hi> For poverty is a cloud, and caſts a darkneſſe over that which is begot of light, ſullies every perfection that is in us, hides it from an eye of fleſh, which cannot ſee wiſdome and poverty together in one man; whereas folly it ſelf ſhall go for wiſdome, and carry away that applauſe which is due to it, if it dwell in the heart, or iſſue from the mouth of a purple and gallant fool; <hi>ut ſumus ſic judicamus,</hi> as we are ſo we judge; and it is not our reaſon which concludes, but our ſence and affection. If we love beauty, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very painted wanton is as the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> and may ask <hi>Solomon</hi> a queſtion; If riches, <hi>Dives</hi> with us will be a better Evangeliſt then Saint <hi>Luke;</hi> If our eyes dazle at Majeſty, <hi>Herods</hi> royall apparrell will be a more eloquent orator then he that ſpeaks, and the people ſhall give a ſhout and cry, <hi>the voice of God and not of man.</hi> Doe but ask your ſelves the queſtion, doth not affection to the perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get admiration in you, and admiration commend whatſoever he ſayes, and gild over errour and ſinne it ſelf, and make them current? do not your hopes or feares or love make up every opinion in you, and build you up in your moſt unholy faith? Is not the Coward, or the Dotard, or the Worldling in your Creed and profeſſion? do
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:59296:364"/> you not meaſure out one another as you do a tree by the bulk and trunk, and count him beſt who is moſt worth? Is not this the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe by which you ſteere? the bond of your peace? Is not this the cement of all your friendſhip? doth not this outward reſpect ſerene or cloud your countenance, and as the wind, the ſtate of things change, make you to day the <hi>deareſt friends,</hi> and to morrow the <hi>deadlieſt enemies?</hi> can you think ill of them you gain by? or ſpeak ill of them you fear? or can he be evil who is powerfull? or dare you be more wiſe then he that hath thirty legions? We may ſay this is a great evil under the ſunne, but it is the property of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſpirit to work good out of evil, to teach us to remember what we are, by thoſe who ſo ſoon make us forget what we are; to make uſe of riches which we dote on, of power, which we tremble at, of that glory which we have in Admiration, to inſtruct us to the knowledge of our condition, and to put us in mind of our mortality and frailty by Kings, whom we count as Gods. Behold a King from his Throne proclaimes it to his ſubjects and all the world, That his power is but as a ſhadow caſt from a mortall; his glory, but his garment which he cannot weare long; and his riches, but the embroidery, which will be as ſoon worn out. And when we have gaz'd and fallen down and worſhipt, and are thus loſt in our own thoughts, if we could take away the filme from our eye, which the world hath drawn over it, and ſee every thing in its nature and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as it is, we ſhould behold in all theſe raies of glorie, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and wealth, nothing but <hi>David the ſtranger.</hi> So that we ſee Kings, who are our nurſing Fathers, are become our School-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to teach us. For we ſee the ignorant and fooliſh men periſh, and they dye as fooles dye, not remembred nor thought on, as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing fell to the ground, but their folly. The begger dyes, but what is that to the rich, who cannot ſee him carried by the Angels into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome? <hi>the righteous alſo periſh,</hi> and no man layes it to heart. I but Kings of the earth fall, and cannot fall but with obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but they fall as a ſtar, are ſoon miſt in their orbe, and ſoon forgot. But then living Kings make their Throne a Pulpit, and preach from thence and publiſh to the world their own fraile and fading condition, meaſure out their life by a ſpan, and propheſie the end of it, call their life a Pilgrimage; and ſhall we not hearken what the Lord God doth ſay by ſuch royall Prophets? ſhall their power make us beaſts of burden to carry it whitherſoever their beck ſhall direct us, and ſhall not their doctrine and example per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us that we are men, travelling men, haſting to another coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? behold then here <hi>David</hi> a Prophet and a King, made and ſet up an enſample to us; and if <hi>David</hi> be a ſtranger upon the earth, we can draw no other concluſion then this, then certainly much more we. If <hi>David</hi> and all his Fathers, If pious Kings and bloody Tyrants, If good and bad found no ſettled eſtate, no abiding place here, why
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:59296:364"/> ſhould we be ſo fooliſh and ignorant, as to turmoile, or ſport and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light our ſelves under the expectation of it? If Kings be pulled down from their Thrones, and fall to the duſt, we have reaſon to caſt up our accounts, and reckon upon it that we are gliding and paſſing, nay poſting and flying as ſo many ſhadows, and that our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall is at hand. For theſe things happened to them for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamples, and they are written for our admonition. They prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied to us, and they ſpake to us, I may ſay, they died to us, and to all that ſhall follow them, to the laſt man that ſhall ſtand upon the earth. When <hi>Adam</hi> had lived nine hundred and thirty yeares, he dyed, lead the way to his poſterity, not that they ſhould live ſo long, but that they ſhould ſurely dye, to every ſonne of his, till the coming of the ſecond and laſt <hi>Adam; Abraham</hi> a ſtranger, and <hi>Moſes</hi> a ſtranger, and <hi>David</hi> a ſtranger, that we might look back upon them, and ſee our condition. And when Patriarchs and Prophets, when Kings preach, not onely living but dying, not onely dying but dead, we ſhall not onely dye, but dye in our ſinnes if we take not out the leſſon; and learn to ſpeak in their dialect and language, <hi>Accolae ſumus &amp; peregrini,</hi> we are ſtrangers and Pilgrimes on the earth. And ſo we paſſe from the perſon, I King <hi>David,</hi> and come to take a neerer view of his condition, and quality;
<q>
                  <p>I am a ſtranger on the earth.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>We paſſe now from the King to the ſtranger and Pilgrime, and yet we cannot paſſe from the one to the other, for they are ever together; for there is ſo neer a conjunction between them, that though the one appeare in glory, the other in diſhonour; the one ſits on a Throne, the other lyes in the duſt; yet they can never be put aſunder, nor ſeparated the one from the other; for he that is a King is but a Pilgrime, and he that is a ſtranger was born and deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto a Kingdome, and a greater Kingdome then <hi>Davids</hi> was. <hi>Thou haſt made us unto our God Kings and Prieſts, and we ſhall reigne upon the earth.</hi> This is the ſong of Pilgrimes, and they ſing it to the <hi>Lamb,</hi> in the fifth of the Revelation, v. 10. The Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is taken by violence, <hi>and the violent take it by force, Mat.</hi> 11.12. And theſe violent men are ſuch as are Pilgrims and ſtrangers; to that place they travell, endure many a ſtorm, many a fall and bruiſe in their way; ſo that the immediate way to be a King, is firſt to be a ſtranger in the earth.</p>
            <p>Now that Man is naturally a ſtranger on the earth, we have the Word of God written, and the Word of God within us; we have both the holy Scripture, and right Reaſon to inſtruct us; both theſe are as the voice of God, and by theſe he ſpeaks unto us, and calls us by our name when he calls us <hi>ſtrangers.</hi>

            <p>And firſt in the Old Teſtament, the life of Man is every where almoſt term'd <hi>a pilgrimage;</hi> ſo <hi>Jacob</hi> in the 47. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> when <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> asked him, How long he hath lived? in his anſwer doth as it were correct his language; <hi>The dayes,</hi> ſaith he, not of my life, but <hi>of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years.</hi> So that in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Jacob</hi> Life and Pilgrimage are all one. The ſame is the language of the New Teſtament: Whilſt we are in the fleſh, <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grinamur à Domino,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. we are abſent, we are travellers, we are wanderers from God; but we are returning to him, on our way, preſſing forward to our home. And though we make haſte out of the world, yet as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> obſerves, ſome ſavour, ſome taſte, ſomething that is from the earth earthy, we ſhall carry about with us till we come to our journeys end. Not onely they are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who with the Prodigall take their journey into a far countrey, and cleave to every vanity there; but they who are ſhaking them off every day, yet look more then they ſhould, and like more then they ſhould, and are not yet made perfect; Not onely they are ſtrangers from God who are Aliens from the houſe of Iſrael, but they who with the Patriarchs in the 11. to the <hi>Heb.</hi> confeſſe themſelves ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in the land which is allotted them, and look for a City whoſe Foundation and Builder is God. It is the obſervation of S. <hi>Hierome</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Dardanus,</hi> That the Saints in Scripture were no where called <hi>Inhabitatores terrae,</hi> the inhabitants of the earth. There is a woe, ſaith he denounced, againſt ſinners, in the eighth of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and under that name; <hi>vae habitatoribus terrae, woe to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the earth.</hi> And Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> almoſt ſpeaks the ſame, where he puts this difference and diſtinction between them; that the righteous can onely be ſaid <hi>eſſe in Tabernaculo carnis,</hi> to be in this tabernacle of the fleſh, to be there, as the Angels are ſaid by the ſchoolmen to be <hi>in uno loco, quòd non ſint in alio,</hi> to be in one place, becauſe they are not in another, but to be circumſcribed no where; and they are onely ſaid to be on the earth, becauſe they are not yet in heaven, but nevertheleſſe have their converſation there; but the wicked do <hi>habitare in Tabernaculo carnis,</hi> do dwell on earth, and have their reſidence in it, and may paſſe into a worſe, but never into a better place; and theſe though they will not be ſtrangers to it, yet are ſtrangers on the earth, and paſſe away from that to which their ſoul was knit, on which they fixed their hope, and glutted their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and raiſed their joy, which was their heaven; they paſſe away and fall from it, and ſhall ſee it no more.</p>
            <p>This then is the voice and language of Scripture; and in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, this even common reaſon may teach us, which is the voice of God, and is our God upon earth, and ſhould be in his ſtead and place to command and regulate us here, and if we were not firſt loſt in our ſelves, if we were not ſtrangers to our ſelves, we
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:59296:365"/> ſhould not ſeek for a place of reſt in that world, whoſe faſhion every day changeth, and which muſt at laſt with its work be burnt with fire. For do we not ſee by this common light, that the mind of man is a thing of infinite capacity, and utterly inſatiable, and here on earth never receives full content? content is that which all men have deſired, but never yet any did attain; but ſtill as one deſire is ſatisfied, another riſeth; and when we have all that we deſired, we will have more; now we would have but this, and when we have it, it is nothing, for our meaſures are enlarged by being filled. Are you learned enough? nay, but there be yet more concluſions to be tried. Are you ever wiſe enough? If but once you be deceived, you will complain that a thouſand things which might have been obſerved have paſt your ſight. But are you ever rich enough? The fool in the Goſpel was not, till his ſoul was fetched away, nor <hi>Dives,</hi> till he was in hell. Nay, are you not moſt miſerably poor when you are moſt abundantly rich? do you not want moſt, when you have moſt? or was ever your heart ſo much ſet on riches as when they did increaſe? or hath the Ambitious any higheſt place, any verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call point? one world was not enough for <hi>Alexander;</hi> and had there been as many as thoſe Atomes of which <hi>Democritus</hi> made it up, he would have wiſhed after more. Our appetite comes by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and our deſires are made keen and earneſt by enjoying, <hi>majora cupere ex his diſcimus,</hi> the obtaining of ſomething doth but prompt us to deſire more. And now to draw this to our preſent purpoſe; If the things of this world be not able to ſatisfie us, if never man yet found full content, if nothing on earth can allay this infinite hunger of the ſoul, which certainly was not imprinted in us in vain; If we cannot find it here, though we ſhould double and treble <hi>Methuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lems</hi> age; If we cannot find it in the world, though we ſhould live to the end of it, we cannot think that the earth ſhould be our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but that the things which we ſo highly eſteem more then our life, more then our ſoul, are unnaturall and ſtrangers to us, and we unto them, and we muſt turn our ſelves about, and look towards ſomething elſe which may meet and fill our deſires, which here find nothing to ſtay, but every thing to enlarge them. Here are delights that vaniſh, and then ſhew their fouleſt ſide; here are riches that makes us poor, and honour that makes us ſlaves; here are nothing but phantaſmes and apparitions, which will never fill us, but feed the very hunger of our ſoules, and increaſe it; there in our country, at our journeys end, there is fulneſſe of joy, which alone can ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie this <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

               </gap> and infinite appetite: and therefore the earth is but our ſtage to walk through, heaven is our proper place and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to this we are bound; here we are but ſtrangers, <hi>ſi velimus accolae, ſi nolimus acccolae,</hi> if we will we may be ſtrangers, and if we will not, but love to dwell and ſtay here, yet we ſhall be ſtrangers whether we will or no.</p>

            <p>And as we are, ſo our abode here is that of ſtrangers in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther country, as of thoſe who are ever in their way, and moving forwards, never ſtanding ſtill, but ſtriving to go out of it; and his whole motion and progreſſe is a leaving it behind him. When <hi>Adam</hi> was Lord of all the world, he was but a ſtranger in it; for God made him naked in Paradiſe, and withall gave him no ſenſe of his nakedneſſe, and the reaſon is given by Saint <hi>Baſil,</hi> that man might not be diſtracted and called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">

But when he was fallen, God clothes him with skins, <hi>ut illum veluti morte qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam indueret,</hi> ſaith <hi>Proclus</hi> in <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that he might clothe him as it were with death it ſelf, which was repreſented unto him in the skins of dead beaſts; that he might alwaies carry about with him the remembrance of it, the moſt ſuitable garment that a ſtranger or Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grime can weare. A ſtranger comes not to ſtay long in a place, he is here (as we ſay) to day and gone to morrow, ſo is man; he flyeth as a poſt, or rather as a ſhadow, and continueth not, <hi>Job</hi> 14. At an end as ſoone as a tale that is told, and not ſo long remembred. There may be many errours in his way, but there is none in his end; and which way ſoever he travels, whereſoever he pitcheth his tent, his journeyes end is the grave. <note place="margin">Tertull. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>This you will ſay is a common theme and argument, and indeed ſo it is; for what more common then death? and yet as common as it is, I know no leſſon ſo much forgotten as this: for who almoſt conſiders how he came into the world, or how he ſhall goe out of it? Ask the Wanton, the Mammoniſt, the Ambitious of their minute, and they will call it Eternity, <hi>Sol iſte, dies nos decipit, &amp;c.</hi> The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the preſent time, that deceives us, and we draw that out to a laſting perpetuity, which is paſt whilſt we think on't; ſuch a bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power hath the love of the world, to make our minute eternity, and eternity nothing; and the day of our death as hard and difficult to our faith as our reſurrection. For though day unto day uttereth knowledge, though the preacher open his mouth, and the grave o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen hers, and we every day ſee ſo many pilgrimes falling in, though they who have been dead long ago, and they who now dye, ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; yet we can hardly be induced to believe that we are ſtrangers, but embrace the world, and rivet our ſelves into it as if we ſhould never part, and we deny that which we cannot deny, reſolve on that which we cannot think, will not be perſwaded of that which we do believe, or believe not that which we confeſſe, but place immortality upon our mortal, &amp; ſo live as if we ſhould never dye. And can we who thus every day enlarge our thoughts and hopes, and let them out at length beyond our <hi>threeſcore yeares and ten,</hi> meaſuring out Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, building of Palaces, anticipating pleaſures and honours, creating that which will never have a being, and yet delighting in it as if we now had it in poſſeſſion; can we who love the world as that friend from which we would never part, but loſe all others for it; can we who would have this to be the world without end, and have ſcarce one thought left to reach at that which is ſo, and to come; can we who love, and admire, and pride our ſelves in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, in nothing elſe, ſay or thinke we are pilgrimes, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journers, and <hi>ſtrangers</hi> in the earth?</p>
            <p>'Tis true, ſtrangers we are (for all are ſo) and paſſing forward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace to our journeyes end, but not to that end for which we were made; and therefore that we may reach and attain to it, we muſt make our ſelves ſo, put off the <hi>old man,</hi> which loves to dwell here, take off our hopes and deſires from it, look upon all its glories as <hi>dung,</hi> look upon the world as a ſtrange place, and upon our ſelves as ſtrangers in it; and look upon the place to which we are going,
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:59296:367"/> and fling off every weight, and ſhake off every vanity; every thing that is of the earth, earthy, make haſte and delay not, but leave it behind us, even while we are in it; for a Chriſtian mans life is nothing elſe but a going out of it.</p>
            <p>And to this end (in the laſt place) you muſt take along with you your <hi>viaticum,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hide not thy commandments from me.</note> your proviſion, <hi>The Commandments of God: (Hide not thy commandments from me,</hi> ſaith <hi>David;</hi> and he ſpoke as a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and as in a ſtrange place, as in a place of danger, as in a dark place, where he could not walk with ſafety, if this light did not ſhine upon him.) For here we meet with variety of objects; here are ſerpents to flatter us, and ſerpents to bite us; here are pleaſures and terrors, all to deceive and detaine us. Here we meet with that arch-enemy to all ſtrangers and pilgrims in ſeverall ſhapes, now as a roaring Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſometimes as an Angel of light; and though we try it not out at Fiſts with him (as thoſe fooliſh Monks boaſted they had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tried this kind of hardiment) though we meet him not as a Hyppocentaure, <note place="margin">Hieron. de vita Pauli Eremitae, &amp; Malchi &amp; Hilarionis.</note> as the ſtory tells us <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Hermite</hi> did; as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre, or ſhee-wolf, as <hi>Hilarion</hi> did, to whom were preſented many fearefull things, the roaring of lions, the noiſe of an Army, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots of fire coming upon him, wolves and foxes, and ſword-plaiers, and I cannot tell what. Though we do not feel him as a Satyre, yet we feel him as voluptuous; though we do not ſee him as a wolf, yet we apprehend him thirſting after blood; though we meet him not in the ſhape of a fox, yet <hi>non ignoramus verſutias,</hi> we are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of his wiles and enterpriſes; though we do not ſee him in the tempeſt, we may in our feare; and though his hand be inviſible, yet we may feel him in our impatience, and falling from the truth; we cannot ſay in our affliction, this is his blow, but we may heare him roare in our murmuring: or we may ſee him in that mungrell Chriſtian made up of ignorance and fury, of a man and a beaſt, which is more monſtrous then any centaure: we may ſee him in that hypocrite, that deceitfull man, who is a fox, and the worſt of the cub; we may meet him in that oppreſſor who is a wolf; in that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and perſecutor who is a roaring lion.</p>
            <p>And in ſome of theſe ſhapes we meet him every day in this our Pilgrimage; and here in the world we can find nothing to ſecure us againſt the world; adverſity may ſwallow up pleaſure in victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but not the love of it; impotency and inhability may bridle and ſtay my Anger, but not quench it; Providence may defend me from evil, but not from feare of it; nor can the world yield us any weapon againſt it ſelf: and therefore God hath opened his Armory of heaven, and given us his commandments to be our light, our proviſion, our defence in our way; to be as our Pilgrimes ſtaff, our Scrip, our letters commendatory, to be our Angels to keep us in all
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:59296:367"/> our waies, and there is no ſafe walking for a ſtranger without them. And as when the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in the wilderneſſe, he rained down <hi>Manna</hi> upon them, and led them as it were by the hand, till he brought them to the land of promiſe, ſo he deales with them, with all that call upon his name whileſt they are <hi>in via,</hi> in this their peregrination, ever and anon beſet with temptations which may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and hinder them; he raines down abundance of his grace, which like that <hi>Manna</hi> will ſerve the appetite of him that takes it, and is like to that which every man wants, applies it ſelf to every taſte, to all the callings and conditions, to all the neceſſities of a ſtranger. Thus we <hi>walk by faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>Feſtina fides,</hi> and faith is on the wing, and leaves the world behind us, is the ſubſtance and evidence of things not ſeen, and looks not on thoſe things which are ſeen, and pleaſe a carnall eye; or if it do, looks upon them as <hi>Joſhua</hi> did upon <hi>Ai,</hi> and firſt turnes the back, and then all its ſtrength againſt them, makes us fly from them that we may overcome them. For <hi>this is the victory which overcometh the world, even our faith.</hi> And <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina ſpes,</hi> hope too is in her flight, and follows our fore-runner <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to enter with him <hi>that which is within the vaile, Heb.</hi> 6.19. <hi>even the holy of holies,</hi> heaven it ſelf; <hi>ſpe jam ſumus in coelo,</hi> we are already there by hope, and to him that hath ſeen the beauty of holineſſe, the world is but a loathſome ſpectacle; to him that truly truſteth in God, it is lighter then vanity, and he paſſeth from it. And then our love of God is our <hi>going forth,</hi> our peregrination; it is a periſhing, a death of the ſoul to the world, and if it be truely fixt, no pleaſure, no terror, nothing in the world can concern us, but they are to us as thoſe things which the travellour in his way ſees, and leaves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day; and we think no more of the glory of them then they who have been dead long ago. <hi>For we are dead,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.3. and our life is hid, hid from the world with Chriſt in God: our temperance taſteth not, our chaſtity toucheth not, our poverty in ſpirit handleth not thoſe things which lye in our way, but paſſeth by them as impertinencies, as dangers, as thoſe things which may pollute a ſoul more then a dead body could under the Law. The <hi>ſtranger,</hi> the pilgrime paſſeth by all, his meekneſſe makes injuries, and his patience afflictions, light; and his Chriſtian fortitude caſteth down every ſtrong hold, every imagination, which may hinder him in his courſe. Every act of piety is a kind of ſequeſtration, and drives us, if not from the right, yet from the uſe of the world. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry virtue is to us as the Angel was to <hi>Lot,</hi> and bids <hi>ariſe, and go out of it;</hi> takes us by the hands, and bids us <hi>haſte and eſcape for our life,</hi> and not to look behind us. And with this proviſion, as it were with the two Tables in our hand, we come neerer and neerer to the end of our faith, the end of our hope, and the end of our love. For he that looks upon the commandments and keeps them hath the will of God, and he that hath his will, hath all that wiſdome can find out,
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:59296:368"/> or power bring to paſſe, hath Gods providence and almightineſſe his companions, his guides, his protection in his way, and the world, the pomp and vanity of it can no more prevaile againſt him then it can againſt God himſelf; but where God is there ſhall this ſtranger be alſo, when paſſing through all theſe he ſhall come to his journeys end.</p>
            <p>For firſt, (that we may make ſome uſe of this, and ſo conclude) this our conformity to the will of God in keeping his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, will make us obſerve a <hi>Decorum,</hi> and being ſtrangers in the earth to behave our ſelves as ſtrangers in it, for neceſſities ſake give a perfunctory and ſlight ſalute, not look upon it as a friend, not to truſt it, not to <hi>truſt in uncertain riches, but in the living God,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 17. but to ſuſpect and be jealous of every thing in it, <note place="margin">Theophr. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> as we uſe to be of every man we meet in a ſtrange place; and as plain country-men, who are ignorant of coines, ſuſpect and try every piece they ſee, and though it be current, yet feare it may be counterfeit. So to ſay within our ſelves, this beauty which ſmiles may bite as a cockatrice; this wine which looks red may be a mocker; theſe riches may be my laſt receit; this ſtrength may ruine me; this wit may befool me; that which makes me great in my own eyes, that for which I flatter and worſhip my ſelf, and tread all others with ſcorn under my feet, may make me the leaſt in the Kingdom of heaven, nay quite ſhut me out; this beauty may bring deformity into my ſoul; this wine may be as the Manichees called <hi>Fel principis tenebrarum,</hi> the gall of the Prince of darkneſſe, and theſe riches may begger me, and my Perfections undoe me. Far better is it for a ſtranger to be cautelous and wary, then too ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous and fool-hardy; better for him to feare where no feare is, then to be ready to meet and embrace every toy and trifle that ſmiles and kils. Now, by this we arme our ſelves againſt all caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties and misfortunes, which is more then all the conveyances and deviſes of the Law, more then the providence of the wiſeſt can do. For what can fall out by chance to him who is ever under the wing of the almighty? or what can be loſe who hath denied all unto himſelf, and himſelf too in every aſpect and relation to the world? This is our proviſion, and this is our ſecurity; &amp; he that will be ſecure muſt learn to be a ſtranger; he that will loſe nothing muſt learn to have nothing; and then as our obedience to Gods will doth keep us in a decorum, ſo it teacheth us by looking on the world with an eye of jealouſie to make it our friend, a friend of <hi>Mammon,</hi> and a friend of a temptation; for ſo we make that which was dangerous benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all unto us, and riſe up as high as heaven upon that which might have been our ruine, by looking upon it with the ſuſpicious and jealous eye of a ſtranger.</p>
            <pb n="617" facs="tcp:59296:368"/>
            <p>Secondly, It ſupplies us with armes, and ſtrengthens us againſt all afflictions, which may beat upon us, all miſeries which befall us, all contumelies which may affront us in our way; for what are all theſe poor ſprinklings, theſe weak breathings of wind and aire to us, when we remember we are but <hi>ſtrangers</hi> in the world? <hi>The world knows us not, becauſe it knows not God,</hi> as Saint <hi>John</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 3.1. <hi>peregrini deorſùm, cives ſurſùm,</hi> ſtrangers here below, but Citizens above. What can they who are ſo unlike to the world, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn the world, expect leſſe? here there will be <hi>Shimeis</hi> to revile us, <hi>Zedekiahs</hi> to ſmite us on the cheek, oppreſſors to grind us, and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants to rob and ſpoile us when they pleaſe; and if we will have them our friends, we muſt make our ſelves like them, and go to hell along with them; but the commandments of God are an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote againſt all theſe. For theſe evils cannot trouble us if we make uſe of the right remedy, which is no where to be found but in Chriſt, in whom all the treaſuries of wiſdome are hid. But one errour of our lives it is, and a great one, to miſtake the remedy of evils, <hi>nec tam morbis laboramus quàm remediis,</hi> nor doth our diſeaſe and malady ſo much moleſt us, as the remedies themſelves. The poor man thinks there is no other remedy for poverty, but riches; the reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger cannot purge his gall and bitterneſſe, but with the blood of his enemy; the ſick is quieted with nothing but with health: but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed theſe are not remedies anſwerable to the nature and operation of theſe ſeverall diſeaſes, for the poor man may become rich, and be poorer then before; the revenger may draw blood, and be more enraged then before; the ſick man may be reſtored to health, and be worſe then before; the will of God is the trueſt, and moſt ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign phyſick, and his will is that we eſtrange our ſelves from the world; that our hearts be fixed on him, and on thoſe pleaſures which are at his right hand for evermore. And then there will be no ſuch things as Poverty, or Injuries, or Sickneſſe, or at leaſt they will not appeare ſo to us, which is all one; nay, which is more, for now they are not what they are unto us, nor do we ſee that horrour in them, which they that dwell in the world do, but as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, when we are poor then we are rich, when we are weak then we are ſtrong, when we are in diſgrace then we are honourable, when we are perſecuted then we are happy, when we are ſick then we are beſt in health, and even ſee our journeys end. <hi>Nihil impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritius impatientia,</hi> Impatience which ever accompanies the neglect of Gods commands, is the moſt ignorant, unskilfull, inexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, the moſt ungodly thing in the world. For theſe complaints in poverty, this impatience of injuries, this murmuring in our ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, are ill ſignes that we love the pleaſures of the world more then the will of God; that we ſee more glory in a piece of earth, then virtue; that we are more afraid of a diſgrace then of ſin; that we bowe with more devotion and affection to the world then to
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:59296:369"/> God, and ſo cannot make this glorious confeſſion with our Kingly Prophet, that we are <hi>Accolae</hi> and <hi>peregrini,</hi> ſtrangers and pilgrims up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, our conformity to the will of God is a precious Antidote againſt the feare of death; the feare of death? why we were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from that, when Chriſt <hi>took part with us of fleſh and blood, Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>and through death deſtroyed him who had the power of death, the devil,</hi> why ſhould any mortall now feare to dye? It is moſt true, Chriſt dyed, and by his death ſhook the powers of the grave; <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummatum eſt,</hi> all is finiſhed, and he is returned victoriouſly with the ſpoils of his enemies, and of this laſt enemy death. But for all this his triumph, death may be ſtill the King of terrours, and as dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as before. All is finiſht on his part, but a covenant conſiſts of two, and ſomething is required on ours. He doth not turn <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> into <hi>Promiſes,</hi> as ſome have been willing to perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and others; <hi>It muſt be done,</hi> is not, thou ſhalt do it; <hi>If thou wilt believe,</hi> is not, <hi>thou ſhalt believe.</hi> But every promiſe, every act of grace of his implies a condition. He delivers thoſe that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be delivered, who do not feed death, and ſupply this enemy with ſuch weapons as make him terrible. All the terrour death hath is from our ſelves, our ſin, our diſobedience to the commands of God, that's his <hi>ſting.</hi> And our part of the covenant is, by the power &amp; virtue of Chriſts death every day to be plucking it from him, and at laſt to take it quite away. We, we our ſelves muſt riſe up againſt this King of terrours, and in the Name and Power of Chriſt take the Scepter out of his hand, and ſpoile him of his ſtrength and terrour. And this we may do by parts and degrees, now cut from him this ſin, now that; now this deſire, and anon another, and ſo <hi>dye daily,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, dye to profit, dye to pleaſure, dye to Honour, be as dead to every temptation which may beget ſin in us, and a ſting in him; and ſo leave him nothing to take from us, not a deſire, not a hope, not a thought, nothing that can make us feare death. Then we ſhall look upon it not as a divorcement from thoſe delights which we have caſt off already, or a paſſage into a worſe condition from that we loved too well, to that we never feared enough; but we ſhall conſider it as a ſleep, as it is to all wearied pilgrims, as a meſſage ſent from Heaven to tell us our walk is at an end, and now we are to lay down our ſtaffe and ſcrip, and reſt in that Jeruſalem which is above, for which we vowed this pilgrimage: <hi>Et quis non ad meliora feſtinat?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Tert. de patientia.</note> What ſtranger will be afraid to return to his Fathers houſe, or loſe that life, <hi>quam ſibi jam ſupervacuam fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit,</hi> which by dying daily to the world he hath already made ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous and unneceſſary? To conclude this: He that truly fears God can feare nothing elſe, nor is Death terrible to any but to thoſe who would build their tabernacle here, who love to feed with ſwine on
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:59296:369"/> husks, becauſe they have not taſted of the powers of the world to come, who wiſh immortality to this mortall, before they put it on; who are willing to converſe and trade with vanity for ever, who deſire not with <hi>David to be ſpared a little,</hi> but would <hi>never goe hence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſt of all, It will moderate our ſorrow for thoſe our friends who are dead, or rather fallen aſleep, or rather at their journeys end. For why ſhould any man who knows the condition of a ſtranger, how many dangers, how many cares, how many ſtormes and tempeſts he was obnoxious to, hang down the head and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that he had now paſſed through them all, and was ſet down at his journeys end? why ſhould he who looks for a City to come, be troubled that his fellow pilgrime came thither, and entred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him? It might be a matter of holy Emulation perhaps, but why it ſhould afflict us with grief I cannot ſee, unleſſe it be becauſe we have not made it our meat and drink to keep Gods command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which might give us a taſte of a better eſtate to come, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be becauſe we have not well learnt to act the part of a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Miſerable men that we are, that we will be; that know not our own quality and condition that are ſtrangers, and yet unwilling to draw neer our ſelves, or to ſee others come to their home, but think them loſt where they are made perfect. We ſtand by the bed of our ſick and dying friend as if he were now removed to a place of torment and not of reſt, and to be either nothing or more miſerable then he was in a region of miſery; we ſend out ſhreeks and outcries to keep time with his gaſps, to call him back, if it were poſſible, from heaven, and to keep him ſtill under the yoke and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; when as the fainting of his ſpirits, the failing of his eyes, the trembling of his joynts, are but as the motion of bodies to their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, moſt violent when they are neereſt to their end. And then we cloſe up his eyes, and with them our hopes, as if with his laſt gaſp he had breathed out his ſoul into aire; when indeed there is no more then this, one pilgrime is gone before his fellows, one gone, and left others in their way in trouble, and more troubled that he is gone to reſt. <hi>Migrantem migrantes praemiſimus,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi> we are paſſing forward apace, and have ſent one before us to his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end, his everlaſting ſabbath. With this contemplation doth reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion comfort and uphold us in our way, and keeps us in that temper which the Philoſopher commends as beſt, in which we do <hi>ſentire deſiderium &amp; opprimere,</hi> ſhe gives nature leave to draw teares, but then ſhe brings in faith and hope to wipe them off; <note place="margin">Sen. ad Marci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am.</note> ſhe ſuffers us to mourn for our friends, but not as men without hope. Nature will vent, and love is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#PDCC">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſaith the Orator, ever querulous and full of complaints when the object is removed out of ſight; and God remembers whereof we are made, is not angry with our love, and will ſuffer us to be men, but then we muſt ſilence one love with
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:59296:370"/> another, our naturall affection with the love of God; at leaſt divide our language thus, <hi>Alas my Father, Alas my Husband, Alas my Friend;</hi> but then he was a <hi>ſtranger,</hi> and now at his journeys end; and here we muſt raiſe our note; and ſpeak it more heartily, Bleſſed are ſuch ſtrangers, <hi>bleſſed are they that dye in the Lord, even ſo ſaith the ſpirit, that they reſt from their labours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For concluſion; let us feare God, and keep his commandments, this is the whole duty of a ſtranger, to obſerve thoſe Lawes, which came from that place to which he is going, let theſe his Lawes be in our heart, and our heart will be an elaboratory, a limbeck, to work the water of life out of the vanities and very dregs of world, through which we are to paſſe. It ſhall be as a rock firm and ſolid againſt every wave and temptation that ſhall beat againſt it, and a ſhop of precious receipts, and proper remedies againſt every evil; It ſhall be <hi>ſpoliarium mortis,</hi> a place where death ſhall be ſtript and ſpoiled of its ſting, and of its terrour. In a word; It ſhall be the Temple of God, an houſe of feaſting and joy, where ſorrow may look in at the window, at the ſenſitive part, but be ſoon chaſed away: It ſhall be even aſhamed of its Tabernacle of fleſh, and pant and beat to get out, that it may be clothed upon, and mortality be ſwallowed up of life. In brief, it will make us <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> and keep us <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> even ſuch ſtrangers, which ſhall be made like unto the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and whom when they come to their journeys end, the Angels ſhall meet, and welcome, and receive into their Fathers houſe, where they ſhall reſt, and rejoyce for evermore.</p>
            <p>I have done with my Text, and now muſt turn your eyes and thoughts upon this pilgrime here, <hi>this Honoured and worthy Knight,</hi> who hath now paſſed through the buſie noiſe and tumults of this world to his long home and reſt. In which paſſage of his (as I have received it from men of place and worth, and unqueſtioned integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) he hath ſo exactly performed the part and office of a ſtranger and pilgrime, that he is followed with the applauſe of them that knew him; and as in his death he is become an argument to prove the doctrine which I have taught, ſo in his life he made himſelf a great enſample for them to look upon who are now travelling and labouring in the ſame way.</p>
            <p>Look upon him then in every capacity and relation, either as a part of the Common-wealth, or a member of the City, or a Father of a Family, and you ſhall diſcover the image and faire repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>ſtranger</hi> in every one of theſe relations; for no man can take this honour to himſelf to be a good Common-wealths-man, a good maſter of a family but he who is as <hi>David</hi> was, a <hi>ſtranger.</hi> All the ataxie and diſorder, all the noiſe we heare, and miſchiefs we ſee
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:59296:370"/> in the world, are from men who love it too well, and would live and dwell and delight themſelves in it for ever.</p>
            <p>For the firſt; I may truly ſay as <hi>Lampridius</hi> did of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> he was <hi>vir bonus &amp; Reipublicae neceſſarius,</hi> he was a good man and of neceſſary uſe in a Common-wealth, and laid all the ſtrength he had to uphold it, and preferred the peace and well-fare of it to his own, as well knowing that a private houſe might ſink and fall to the ground, and yet the Common-wealth ſtand and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; but that the ruine of the whole muſt neceſſarily draw with it the other parts, and at laſt bury them in the ſame grave. And here he found as rough a paſſage as <hi>Aufidienus Rufus</hi> in <hi>Tacitus</hi> did in that commotion and rebellion of <hi>Percennius,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tacit.</hi> l. 1. Annal.</note> who was pulled out of his chariot, loaded firſt with ſcoffs and reproches, and then with a fardell of ſtuffe, and made to march foremoſt of all the company, and then ask'd in ſcorn, <hi>whether he bore his burden willingly?</hi> or whether ſo long a journey was not tedious and irkſome to him? ſo was this worthy Knight taken from his wife whom he entirely loved, and from his children thoſe pledges of his love, conveyed to ſhip, and by ſhip to priſon in a remote City, where he found ſome friends, and then brought back from thence to a priſon neerer home, where (if the providence of God had not gone along with him, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed him) he had met the plague; ſo that in ſome meaſure that befell him which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf, <hi>He was in journeying often, in perills of waters, in perills of his own Country-men, in perills in the City, in perills on the Sea, in perills amongst falſe brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid, what praiſe is it to ſuffer all this, if he ſuffer as an evil doer, and for conſcience towards God? I come not hither to diſpute that, but am willing to refer it to the great triall which ſhall open every eye to behold that truth, which now being dazled with feares and hopes, and even blinded with the <hi>love of the world,</hi> it cannot ſee. But if it were an errour, and not knowledg but miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take drove him upon theſe pricks, yet ſure it was an errour of a faire deſcent, begot in him by looking ſtedfaſtly on the truth, by having a ſteddy eye <hi>on the oath of God, Eccleſ.</hi> 8.2. and if here he fell, he fell like a Chriſtian, who did exerciſe himſelf to keep a good conſcience; for he that follows not his conſcience when it errs, will be as far from hearkning to it when it ſpeaks the truth; for even errour it ſelf ſhews the face of truth to him that erres, or elſe he could not erre at all. And yet (I need not feare to ſay it) It is an errour of ſuch a nature, that it may rather deſerve applauſe then cenſure, even from thoſe who call it by that name; for we do not uſe to fall wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly into ſo dangerous, vexatious, and coſtly errours; errours, which will ſtrip us, which will put a yoke upon us; errours which will put us in priſon; no, to fly from theſe we too oft fly from the truth it ſelf,
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:59296:371"/> when 'tis as open as the day, and commands or faith though not our tongue, and forceth our aſſent, when we renounce it. Private intereſt, love of our ſelves, feare of reſtraint, hope of advancement, theſe are the mothers commonly of this monſter which we call <hi>errour</hi> when we do not erre, and in theſe it is ingendred and bred, as ſerpents are in carrion or dung. He that erres and loſeth by it, erres moſt excuſably, and ſhews plainly that he would not erre, for who would do that which will undoe him?</p>
            <p>Again, take him in the City, in which he bore the higheſt honour, and filled the greateſt place, and was rather an ornament to it then that unto him; for he ſate in it as a ſtranger and a pilgrime, as a man going out of the world, nor did ſo much conſider his power as his duty, which lookt forward, and had reſpect on that which cannot be found in this, but is the riches and glory of another world; and therefore this world was never in his thoughts, never came in to ſowre Juſtice, to turn judgement into worm-wood by corrupting it, or into vinegar by delaying it; no cries of orphans, no teares of the widdow, no loud complaints of the oppreſſed to diſquiet him in his paſſage, which uſe to follow the oppreſſor even to the gates of hell, and there deliver him up to thoſe howlings which are ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. How oft hath he been preſented to me, and that by prudent and judicious men, as the honour and glory of the City? And thus he went on his way full of temptations and troubles, and full of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, even of thoſe honours which he refuſed, for you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how he bore this great office, and you may remember how he refuſed it, and gained as much honour in the hearts of men by the laſt as by the firſt; as much honour by withdrawing himſelf and ſtaying below, as he did formerly in ſitting in the higheſt place with the ſword in his hand. For the ſtate and face of things may be ſuch, as may warrant <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> wiſh and choice, and make it more commendable <hi>in exilium ire quàm tribunal,</hi> to go into baniſhment then to aſcend the tribunal; for he beſt deſerves honour, who can in wiſdome withdraw himſelf; he can beſt manage power, who knows when to lay it down.</p>
            <p>Bring him now from the publick ſtage of honour to his private houſe, and there you might have ſeen him walking, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, in the midſt of his houſe in innocency and with a perfect heart, as an Angel or intelligence moving in his own ſphere, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on every thing in it with that order and <hi>Decorum</hi> which is the glory of a ſtranger; whoſe moving in it is but a going out of it to render an account of every act and motion; you might have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him looking with a ſettled and immoveable eye of love on his wife, walking hand in hand with her for forty foure yeares, and walking with her as his fellow-traveller, with that love which
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:59296:371"/> might bring both at laſt to the ſame place of reſt. You might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him looking on his children with an eye of care as well as of affection, initiating them into the ſame fellowſhip of pilgrims; and on his ſervants, not as on ſlaves, <note place="margin">Quid Servus? Amicus hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milis.</note> but as his humble and inferiour friends, as <hi>Seneca</hi> calls them, and as his fellow-pilgrims too; and thus he was <hi>Domeſticus Magiſtratus,</hi> a Domeſtick Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, a lover and example of that truth which <hi>Socrates</hi> taught, that they who are good Fathers of their family will make the beſt and wiſeſt Magiſtrates; they who can manage their own cock-boat may be fit at laſt to ſit at the ſtern of the common-wealth; for a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate family is a type and repreſentation of it, nay, ſaith <hi>Euſebius,</hi> (in the life of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>) of <hi>the Church it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſſe I knew but in his evening, when he was neer his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end, and then too but at ſome diſtance; but even then I could diſcover in him that ſweetneſſe of diſpoſition, that courteous affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> commends as virtues, but have loſt that name with Hypocrites, with proud and ſupercilious men, who make it a great part of their Religion to pardon none but themſelves, and then think that they have put off the old man when they have put off all humanity. In theſe Omilitick vertues I could diſcern a fair proficiency in this reverend Knight, and what my knowledg could not reach was abundantly ſupplied and brought unto me by the joynt teſtimony of thoſe who knew him, and by a teſtimony which commends him to heaven, and God himſelf, the mouthes of the poor which he ſo often filled. Thus did he walk on as a ſtranger, comforting and ſupporting his fellow-Pilgrims, and reaching forth his charity to them as a ſtaffe. Thus he expreſt himſelf living, and thus he hath expreſt himſelf in his laſt Will, which is <hi>voluntas ultra mortem,</hi> the Will, the Mandate, the Language of a Dead man; <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum morum,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pliny,</hi> the Glaſſe, wherein you may ſee the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that is, the Face, the Image of a Pilgrim, by which he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed a Legacy of Comfort and Supply (a plain acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he was but a ſtranger on the earth) to every Priſon, and to many Pariſhes within this City, and <hi>remembers them who are in bonds,</hi> as one who himſelf was in the body, and ſometimes a priſoner as they. I know, in this world it is a hard thing <hi>Juſtum eſſe ſine infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> to be good and not to heare ill; <hi>expedit enim malis neminem eſſe bonum,</hi> for evil men make it their work to deface every faire image of virtue, and then think well of themſelves when they have made all as evil as themſelves; but it was this our honoured brothers hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe to find no accuſer but himſelf, I may truly ſay, I never yet heard any; but report hath given him an honourable paſſe: the voice of the poor was, <hi>He was full of good works;</hi> the voice of the City, <hi>he was a good Magiſtrate;</hi> the voice of his equalls, <hi>he was a true friend;</hi> the voice of all that I have heard, <hi>he was a juſt man;</hi> and then our
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:59296:372"/> charity will ſoon conclude <hi>he was a good Chriſtian,</hi> for he lived and died a ſon of the Church, of the reformed, and according to the way which ſome call <hi>Hereſy,</hi> ſome <hi>Superſtition,</hi> ſo worſhipped he the <hi>God of his Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now he is gone to his long home, and the mourners go about the ſtreets: He is gone to the grave in a full age, when that was well neer expired which is but <hi>Labour and ſorrow,</hi>
